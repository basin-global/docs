This document is a work in progress and will probably never be "done".  The economy, technology, culture, science, the climate and our world are rapidly changing.  This doc will change with it.

We have done our best to post this work in a "finished" form.  But frankly, there are unfinished sections, typos**,** errors with corrections and clarifications to be made.  We welcome your feedback, comments, critique and involvement.

### **Glad you are here.**

#### Did you check the Docs?

This gitbook is a cumulation of decades of experience, years of research, one whitepaper, two pitch decks and endless iteration.  It is considered the "[Friendly Helping Book](https://phish.net/faq/helping-friendly-book)" of Basin.  If you have questions about Basin we will do our best to answer but will most likely rhetorically ask "Di_d you check the Docs?_".
