# Scouts

Scouts are Members who help Basin scout for properties. &#x20;

Scouts typically work in a [Basin Bioregion](../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/basins.md) that they are familiar with.  However, Scouts can scout wherever they like.  They can work on the ground or online.

Scouts use the [$BASIN Property Protoco](../basin-property-protocol/)l to help identify and onboard properties that fit the current Basin criteria.

Every property onboarded into Basin will be tagged with the Scout(s) who found and/or onboarded it.  On a deal by deal basis, Scouts will have the option to earn finder fee's (subject to local law), participate in the deal or run the deal.

Scouting is very similar to what, in the real estate industry, is called bird-dogging or driving for dollars.  But in Basin's case the outcome is climate, nature and carbon impact projects not extractive development.

All [Members](../community/network-participants/members.md) are eligible to become a Scout.  To become a Scout, simply start submitting properties in Discord and we will show you the next steps to using the Basin dApp.
