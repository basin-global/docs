# WorkStreams

Based off of the [Climate Sprint](https://www.climatesprints.com/) model, WorkStreams are focused efforts around a specific problem or outcome.  Anyone can organize a WorkStream and run it how they see fit but we do have some best practices to help community members be as successful as possible.

1. Propose the WorkStream in Discord and/or the Headwaters.  Gather feedback and support.
2. Define the leader(s), team, deadline and what a successful outcome looks like.
3. Develop a Spec and a Deliverable.
4. Get to work! Make an Impact!

The [Core Benefits Label](http://core-benefits.org/) was a result of this [Climate Sprint](https://www.climatesprints.com/packs/cobenefits-finance).&#x20;

We have found that WorkStreams work best with one or at most two people as leaders and a team of 2-5 people working in 1-4 week sprints with 3 weeks being the ideal time.  Asking people for written and/or public commitment to the whole sprint increases success.

The Spec is the outline for the work. The Deliverable is what you hope to deliver to the community.

WorkStreams are eligible for funding from the Treasury by posting in the Headwaters as a Pitch, getting traction as a Proposal and reaching general Consensus.&#x20;
