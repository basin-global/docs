# Operations

basin.global is a _real_ Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): not just people acting as a group but an Organization of HoldCo's, OpCo's and ProCo's and $BASIN's (people, organizations, ecosystems, RoN) all acting in concert.

While there are varied definitions of DAO's, we operate as an ecosystem of interconnected nodes along the lines of Ostrom's Polycentric Governance: "a form of governance with multiple centers of semiautonomous decision making".

Members govern, operate and participate basin.global via [Governance](../governance/), the [Basin Protocol](../basin-property-protocol/) and [$BASIN ReFi Mechanism](../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/).
