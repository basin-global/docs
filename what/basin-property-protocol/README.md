# Basin Property Protocol

## PropTech is ClimateTech is NatureTech

Basin a tech enabled real estate solution to the climate crisis.&#x20;

The Basin Property Protocol is being built in conjunction with the [$BASIN ReFi Mechanism](../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/).  When combined with the Basin [HoldCo OpCo PropCo](../../how/business-model/holdco-opco-propco/) model it IS PropTech that is ClimateTech and NatureTech.

## Basin Protocol

The Basin Property Protocol:

* **identifies** both degraded/undervalued and pristine/threatened properties
* **evaluates** them for climate impact and financial feasibility
* **onboards** select properties and property rights at the lowest cost
* **connects** all the tools and resources needed for climate project development

### basinStack

Core to the Basin Protocol is the [basinStack](basinstack.md), our holistic real estate and natural capital valuation and assessment tool.  The basinStack does three things:

1. Assessment tool it reveals all the potential flows of value from a property for climate outcomes and identifies needed partners, docs, data and strategies.
2. Establishes and sets the baseline for a project/property. All backed by MRV and data, the Protocol tracks changes over time to mint ecological assets.
3. interoperable and composable dApp that others can connect to and build apps/plugins on top. Individual polygons (PropCo's) are the base layer.

### climate.lease

The [climate.lease](climate.lease.md) utilizes the basinStack to account for and reconcile the "stocks and flows" of value from the Higher and Better Use of Real Estate. The Basin Protocol forms the structure for climate optimized HoldCo OpCo PropCo structures.

## MVP & Private Beta

The Basin Protocol is currently in private beta.  You can learn more by joining the [expedition](../../quick-links/official-links.md) and getting involved.
