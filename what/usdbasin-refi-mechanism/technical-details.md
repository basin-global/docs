No formal decisions have been made as we are exploring and evaluating different blockchains based on community, philosophy, funding and technology for our specific use case.   We are balancing short term needs like speed to market and access to liquidity with long term goals of limiting switching costs and building something that is going to outlive us.

Current evaluation:

* use of ERC-4626 vaults
* ERC-20 compatibility
* ERC-1155 NFT flexibility
* L1 for Store of Value
* L2 for Transactions and Flow of Value
* Regen Network for Ecocredits
* Interesting use cases of Charged Particles, Drips and Soulbound cross chain functionality
* Quadratic Funding and Gitcoin Passport
