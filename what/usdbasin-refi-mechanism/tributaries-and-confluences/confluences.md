# Confluences

Confluences are the connection points in and to Basin.  They are the people, organizations, projects and properties that provide key products and services to the network and/or are the interoperable and composable DeFi and ReFi mechanisms.&#x20;

The main difference of Confluences from Tributaries is that they are independent and sovereign of basin.global.  They can choose when and how to interact with the network via the Eddyline (swap) or .basin $STREAMS cycle.

Almost all $BASIN's are considered Confluences and they can form a Tributary as part of Stratification.
