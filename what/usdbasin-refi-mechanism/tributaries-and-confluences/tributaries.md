# Tributaries

The word tributary comes from the latin word tributarius: "paying tribute".  Basin is designed like the Water Cycle found in nature.  Just as water flows and circulates in a watershed, so does value in Basin.

Collectively, the Basin Trust, Basin Foundation and basinDAO are the Mainstem Tributaries.  The Treasury is referred to as the Aquifer.   Value flows to the Aquifer based on pro rata ownership (IRL/Fiat) and via the .basin domain hyperstructure (for fungible value).  Value mostly flows "downhill" but also is bi-directional like the water table or tides; incentives set in tokenomics to manage this flow.&#x20;

Tributaries in Basin are:

* Basin branded HoldCo, OpCo's and PropCo's that operate key parts of the protocol
* climate, carbon and nature real estate project joint ventures tied to a location
* geographic locations of basins, ecosystems and species
