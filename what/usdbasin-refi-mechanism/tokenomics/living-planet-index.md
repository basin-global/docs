# Living Planet Index

The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a measure of the state of the world's biological diversity based on population trends of vertebrate species from terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats.  The [LPI](https://livingplanetindex.org/) was adopted by the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) as an indicator of progress towards its 2011-2020 targets and will play an important role in monitoring progress towards the post-2020 goals and targets from COP15 (2022).
