# Gini Index

The Gini Coefficient or Gini Index is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality or the wealth inequality within a nation or a social group.  The Gini coefficient was developed by the statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.

The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as the levels of income.  A Gini coefficient of 0 expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values.  For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, if for a large number of people only one person has all the income or consumption and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be nearly one.

We can use the [Gini Coefficient](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI) by world, country or region to establish local stakeholder reward levels and capital weighting within deal structure.
