# Gross Happiness

## Gross National Happiness Index

Gross National Happiness is a term coined by the Fourth King of Bhutan.  The concept implies that sustainable development should take a holistic approach towards notions of progress and give equal importance to non-economic aspects of wellbeing.  [The Gross National Happiness Index](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view\&type=99\&nr=266\&menu=1449) is a single number index developed from 33 indicators categorized under nine domains. The GNH Index is constructed based upon a robust multidimensional methodology known as the Alkire-Foster method.

The concept of GNH has often been explained by its four pillars: **good governance, sustainable socio-economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation**.  The four pillars have been further classified into nine domains in order to create widespread understanding of GNH and to reflect the holistic range of GNH values.  **The nine domains are: psychological well-being, health, education, time use, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards.** The term wellbeing here refers to fulfilling conditions of a "good life" as per the values and principles laid down by the concept of Gross National Happiness.

## The World Happiness Report&#x20;

The GNI is a metric of the Kingdom of Bhutan and to our knowledge is not assessed elsewhere.  As an alternative we can use The World Happiness Report.

The World Happiness Report uses global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries worldwide.  The [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, powered by the Gallup World Poll data.

## Use in $BASIN

We can use the methodology of GNH Index and the four pillars and nine domains and/or the WHR data across countries where projects are located or at the community level to create and manage incentives of [$BASIN tokenomics](./).
