# Tokenomics

{% hint style="warning" %}
This section is in heavy development and iteration.  Please [get involved](../../../quick-links/official-links.md) to see latest iteration.  We are seeking input and participation.  Please join the [convo](../../../quick-links/official-links.md).  Details related to below will be part of our Technical release.

As a solution to Climate Change, $BASIN $STREAMS tokenomics will be tied to global climate change and societal health statistics and metrics.  Network incentives are managed in accordance with societal progress. &#x20;

## The Eddyline (Incentives)

In hydrology, an Eddy is defined as "_a circular movement of water, counter to a main current_".  Eddylines are where the currents meet and exchange flow.  The Basin Eddyline is incentivized value exchange.  These are the current incentives are evaluating and working on.

### Basics

In addition to the below we are working on Supply, Sales, normal Staking, Liquidity and Fractional Reserve metrics.&#x20;

### Aquifer

The Trust Treasury is called the Aquifer.  Aquifers hold and transfer flow.  The Trust will set a "Water Table" level of value, anything below that value is considered Recharge and anything above that value is considered discharge.  Discharge is distributed to $BASIN's based on staked value.

### Strata

Basins are made of strata: rock and sedimentary layers deposited over time.  As a gamification mechanism, $BASINS can be Stratified or "layered-up".   Each layer unlocks perks and benefits.

### Burn

In addition to normal burn mechanisms found in crypto networks we are looking at a burn mechanism for 1) every dollar of value of land permanently conserved and 2) every ton of carbon retired.

### $STREAMS Swaps

$BASIN's recharge the Aquifer by swapping for $STREAMS.  Anything of value can be swapped outright: fiat, USDC, DAI, real estate, skills, expertise, time, carbon credits, DAO shares, tokens, LLC shares, oil and gas rights, etc.  The Swap rate is determined by governance. 1.1X, 1.2X, 1.5X etc.   The Trust will determine how swapped items are managed.

### Trust Staking

As part of our conceptual $BASIN vault (ERC-4626) anything of value could staked in the Trust's $BASIN.  Rather than swapping outright Members could loan something of value to the Trust and earn yield (wrapped ERC-20).

### Trophic Energy Transfer

Trophic energy is the amount of energy that flows or gets passed through an ecosystem.  Basin Tributaries pass flow either to their nested geographic Basins or to the Trust directly.  Most ecosystems pass about 10% of energy from one level to the next.  Basin will set this number by governance.

### Common-Place & Common-Interest

Basin is primarily organized place as $BASIN's (Tributaries & Confluences).  But the basinStack also allows for organization by theme or interest. &#x20;

Feeling bullish or bearish on a place or pollination or water quality?  Mint a $BASIN around that interest/theme/place to support it and earn yield.  Yield can be set based on governance.

### Length of Stake Voting

Rather than token quantity voting or staked token voting we are looking at weighting votes not only on the amount staked but the length of the stake.  i.e. a stake of 50 years (yes 50 years) would have higher weight than 21 days or 1 year etc.

### Quadratic Funding

Similar to Common-Place / Common-Interest but a separate use case is using Quadratic Funding to fund Tributaries via Confluence votes.

## **Incentive Metrics**

The Incentive Metrics are used to assess our impact as well as society's ability to effectively create climate mitigation and adaptation solutions.  The Incentive Metrics are used to set [Incentives](./#incentives).

### Other Metrics

We are also considering other metrics for inclusion on the Incentive Metrics including but not limited to certain SDG's using the [SDG Tracker](https://sdg-tracker.org/), and natural capital / natural asset accounts quality and condition similar to that proposed by the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Natural-Capital-Accounting-Strategy.pdf) using [SEEA](https://seea.un.org/).
