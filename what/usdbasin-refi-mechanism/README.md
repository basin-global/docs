## Regenerative Finance

Basin is, literally, ReFi.  Basin uses Regenerative Finance to regenerate the earth.

The $BASIN ReFi Mechanism circulates Real Value from network climate project activity to fund conservation and the natural capital of the global Commons in perpetuity.

Basin's organizational design is modeled after the water cycle that flows through landscapes big and small: filling, replenishing and spreading vitality.

Basin network activity from real estate based climate projects creates conditions for the individual to prosper and the collective to flourish.

## $STREAMS fill $BASINS

$BASIN is network access and store of value.

$STREAMS is the unit of account and flow of value.

$BASIN $STREAMS are designed to incentivize the perpetual restoration and conservation of ecosystems.  The more network activity, the more ecosystems and carbon sinks (properties) that are restored, regenerated and conserved.

As a legacy asset, $BASIN is designed to create shared upside and reduced risk for ALL of nature and people.  $STREAMS is designed to represent the value of what is technically priceless and circulate that value.  Both tokens provide governance, utility, access, yield and value accrual.

$BASIN is synonymous with basin.global and represents the of value of all network activity but also the value created for the planet and society.

## What is $BASIN?

### Symbolically

In nature, basins catch, store and filter.  Every basin is different and unique.

$BASIN is known as the Treasury of Treasures.  Clean water. Clean air.  Healthy functioning thriving ecosystems and society.  Peace.  Balance.  Harmony.

$BASIN is Security, not a security.  Biodiversity Security.  Water Security.  Carbon Security.  Food Security.  Security of Culture, History and Well Being.

$BASIN represents true wealth: well-being, health, happiness, prosperity and preservation.

### Functionally

$BASIN is a vessel of value.  All Tributaries and Confluences (network participants) have a $BASIN.  Every $BASIN is unique.  Any type of value can be stored in a $BASIN to accrue more value and to signal what is truly valuable.

### Technically

Details are forthcoming in the Technical Docs but $BASIN is bundle of soulbound tokens that each perform different functions.  $BASIN's are composed of a suite of non-fungible and fungible tokens and token vaults.  Each network participant has their own $BASIN and all $BASIN's are unique.  $BASIN's can be "Stratified" to add more functionality.  Stratified $BASIN's are rare and precious but full of abundance and value.

The $BASIN market cap it the sum of the value all $BASINs.

## What is $STREAMS?

### Symbolically

Water is our lifeblood.  All living things need water to survive.  Humans can go three weeks without food but would be lucky to live 3 days without water.  Without water, life as we know it would not exist.

Water is a cycle, always moving, circulating, recharging and discharging.

Water is priced but is simultaneously priceless.  $STREAMS is the water of $BASIN.

### Functionally

$STREAMS is the flow of value through $BASINS.  $STREAMS represent forms of value and capital in $BASIN.  $STREAMS can equate human capital, natural capital or financial capital.  $STREAMS recharge Aquifers and discharges extra value.

Society does not properly account for what is valuable, $STREAMS does and puts this value on your balance sheet.

### Technically

$STREAMS is fungible community token that accounts for different types of value in $BASIN and each $BASIN's recharge (patronage) of the network.

Governance will set Treasury Recharge levels and anything above will be discharged to $BASINs.
