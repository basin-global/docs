# Key Principles

These are in addition and supplementary to [The Basin Manifesto](../../why/manifesto/).

### Stakeholders not Shareholders

All investment and operational decisions take all stakeholders into account.&#x20;

### Types of Capital

We respect and value all types of capital but focus on natural, social and financial.&#x20;

### IIR (Income, Impact, Return) not IRR (Internal Rate of Return)&#x20;

* **Income:** money is a necessity in our lives, allows us to take care of our families and do the work we do. The capital invested should produce an annual cash return.&#x20;
* **Impact:** negative societal and environmental impacts are eliminated and minimized while positive impacts are enhanced and maximized.&#x20;
* **Return:** there must be both a financial and impact return on investment.&#x20;

### Longtermism

All investments are made with the longest time frame in mind to consideration of future generations.  Funds are open ended/evergreen/perpetual.&#x20;

### Clouds and Dirt

We create in the clouds and manifest in the dirt.  Can’t have one without the other. (cred GaryVee)

### "If it is not fun why do it?"

Who says important work can’t be fun?  (cred Ben & Jerry's)

### “What good shall I do this day?”&#x20;

We ask ourselves this daily. (cred Ben Franklin)

### Do real sh!t

* **“RWA” - Real World Assets:** The metaverse is cool but we do live on a tangible and resource-constrained earth. We bridge the two.&#x20;
* **Real People:** climate is "real life".  Anon/pseudo’s can help but we prefer working with people we know like and trust
* **MRV**: Real data, real measurability , ground truth.

### Grow your "stake" and eat it too

We work to build the network value.&#x20;

### #investable

To create maximum IIR, investments are institutional size and quality.  Deals and projects are designed to be Investable.

### Accessible

Basin is open to contributors of all shapes and sizes.&#x20;

### Nana korobi ya oki

Fall down seven times, get up eight.&#x20;

### Show Your Work

We build in public and share best practices to scale solutions.&#x20;

### Honor

Abide by the [Basin Covenants](covenants.md): discretion, privacy and non-circumvention&#x20;

### Global Starts Local

Cumulative local action leads to global change.  To this end we are organized by river basin.
