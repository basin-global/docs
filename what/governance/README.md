# Governance

Each node of basin.global is autonomous and makes its own decisions in context of Manifesto, Core Values, Key Principles and Covenants.&#x20;

$BASIN has two types of governance:

* basinDAO:  1:1 token voting
* Basin Trust: weighted conviction voting based on the value of your $BASIN staked and for how long.

Governance discussions can happen in any communication [channel ](../../quick-links/official-links.md)but longer form discussion should be posted in the [Headwaters](https://headwaters.basin.global/) (not fully launched yet).

Votes are currently by general consensus and/or by progressive decentralization with BASIN LLC as current (Oct 2022) central entity.&#x20;
