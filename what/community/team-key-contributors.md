# Team / Key Contributors

### Different by Design

The nature of DAO's is fluid and so are the people.  basin.global is built as a new type of organization; more of an organism or an ecosystem.  It ebbs, flows, grows, stabilizes, adapts.

We are a start-up but not in the traditional sense of "founders and core team and then everyone else".   **Every contribution counts.   And Basin is the cumulation of every contribution.** &#x20;

Whether it be the people who were here at the very beginning enticed by the potential of web3 or the climate people who pop in when they have time still looking to make an impact or Advisors who keep tabs on the project and offer the right idea at the right time or the Stewards and Elders who are here day to day, week to week for the long term or the Investors or Patrons supporting the network for their own reasons or the Partners and Members who keep everything running... **it all matters.**

### So who are we?  Who is the "Team"?&#x20;

Just like water flowing through a Basin, the Team is everyone who has been here and everyone who will come.&#x20;

We are a Multidisciplinary Team Creating Transdisciplinary Results.  People turning [Climate FUD to Climate FOMO](../../why/manifesto/climate-fud-to-climate-fomo.md). &#x20;

We are PhD's, Masters, senior executives, academics, philanthropists, entrepreneurs, activists, concerned citizens, local stakeholders, architects, scientists, ecologists and more.&#x20;

Climate Change is complex and two or seven or even twenty co-founders are not going to solve it.  Basin is building for **depth** with local skills and domain specific knowledge and **breadth** with business, operational and global savvy.

As of October 2022, our community is over 2,000 people.  Core Contributors can be found in our [Notion](../../quick-links/official-links.md).
