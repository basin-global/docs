# Community

basin.global is a diverse multidisciplinary community creating transdisciplinary climate solutions that restore, regenerate and conserve land to support the natural capital of the global commons.&#x20;

For our projects to restore and protect biodiversity, habitat and ecosystems, to reduce and remove carbon and to improve human health and wealth **we have built and continue to build a community and team that is both wide and deep**.

People are drawn to Basin by the opportunity to create real, on the ground change.  Literally on the ground with nature, ecosystems, carbon sinks and real estate.

They come to turn [Climate FUD to Climate FOMO](../../why/manifesto/climate-fud-to-climate-fomo.md). &#x20;

The Basin Community is made up of real people doing real things.  They are entrepreneurs, scientists, concerned citizens, PhD's, Masters, artists, academics, philanthropists, activists, local stakeholders, architects, ecologists, senior executives, parents, programmers, real estate professionals, content creators, storytellers, film makers and more.&#x20;

**All have come for one thing: to take action by giving their gifts to the world.**
