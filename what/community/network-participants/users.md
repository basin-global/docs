# Users

As an open public network, anyone can become a $BASIN token holder.

Users are token holders who are non-Members. &#x20;

Users use the network for their particular purpose and for whatever reason do not want access to the benefits of being a Member.  In most cases, these are actors who prefer to remain anonymous or pseudonymous or who are speculating on the network.

Membership is based on $BASIN Stratification in [usdbasin-refi-mechanism](../../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/ "mention")
