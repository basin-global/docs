# Network Participants

basin.global is a collaboration between local on the ground stakeholders and the global Basin community.  The results happen, literally, on the ground at the project, property and landscape level but are supported, sustained and built upon by the collective effort of the network participants.

There are two types of $BASIN network participants: **Users** and **Members**.

**Users**: anyone can be a network user and does not have to be a Member.

**Members**: people and organizations who steward the network and protocol.

Membership is based on $BASIN Stratification in [usdbasin-refi-mechanism](../../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/ "mention")
