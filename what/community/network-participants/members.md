# Members

Members are token holders who steward the network and protocol.&#x20;

To become a Member, a $BASIN holder simply Stratifies their $BASIN.  Membership is based on $BASIN Stratification in [usdbasin-refi-mechanism](../../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/ "mention")

Member types are Patrons, Stewards, Partners and Investors.

Members get tiered access to specific parts of the $BASIN Property Protocol.  Members can be people and/or organizations.  The people and organizations each fill unique roles in the $BASIN ecosystem.

Members operate individually or collectively or both.  Individual actions happen at [Confluences](../../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/confluences.md). Collective actions happen at the [Tributaries](../../usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/tributaries.md).&#x20;
