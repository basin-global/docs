# Nature Risk

Half of the worldâ€™s GDP, $44 Trillion, is at risk due to Nature Loss.

Our economies, and us, are embedded within nature - not external to it.&#x20;

Commonly known as the biodiversity crisis, one million animals and plants are now threatened with extinction.  Approximately 150 species are permanently lost daily.

To avoid a mass extinction, the world needs to invest an additional \~**$700B per year** in nature and biodiversity.
