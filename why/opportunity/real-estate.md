# Real Estate

Underneath All is the Land.

Regardless of what you call it:  Real Estate.  Real Property.  Real Assets.  Property is the the largest global market in existence: over $350T.

But over 75% of Earth’s lands are substantially degraded and over 40% of global carbon emissions come from real estate and construction.

Luckily, the IPCC concludes:

* Ecosystem & land restoration categories have the highest potential for carbon removal: 2.9 gigatons annually.
* Up to 61% of global building emissions could be cut by 2050

**Basin uses the “bundle of rights” embedded in real estate to attract agnostic and indifferent capital to climate, nature and carbon projects.**
