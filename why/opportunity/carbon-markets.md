# Carbon Markets

The voluntary carbon market grew 60% to $1B last year and is projected to grow 100x by 2050.&#x20;

Carbon prices continue to rise.  More legislation, possible carbon tax schemes, lack of supply and significant demand from net zero corporations will push CO2 prices much much higher.&#x20;

Higher carbon prices means more capital for better quality climate projects and/or buyers seeking new alternatives to traditional offset purchases.

More importantly, every tonne of GHG removal delivers $664 in additional economic, social & environmental co-benefits.  At $20 per tonne, the 5 year Impact IRR is 101%.
