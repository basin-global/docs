# 🗝 Golden Spike

Real Estate is the Golden Spike for Climate Change.

The golden spike is the ceremonial 17.6-karat gold final spike driven to join the rails of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States connecting the Central Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad in 1869 in Utah Territory. &#x20;

The term golden spike has been used to refer to one driven at the ceremonial completion of railroad construction projects in which construction is undertaken from two disparate origins towards a common meeting point.

Real Estate is the golden spike.  $BASIN is the hammer.
