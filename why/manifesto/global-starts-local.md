# üåê Global Starts Local

It's great to have grand global visions.  But who are we to tell everyone what to do?

Instead of telling, let's build, offer and maintain the tools and resources for local action.

Global ideals are too far removed from local ecosystems and communities to create effective change.  But every local initiative matters, the cumulative effects of many, even if small, local measures accumulate at the global level.  Social, and usually local or regional, tipping points have more leverage and can be adjusted whereas ecosystem tipping points are slow and hard to reverse or irreversible.

The Basin multi-stakeholder approach prioritizes local and bioregional solutions.  Basin is [organized](../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/basins.md) according to basins, or watersheds.  These watersheds align closely with the same nature made bioregions that humans have been organizing around for thousands of years.

How do we solve climate change?  Ecosystem by Ecosystem. &#x20;

And in Basin's case:  Project by Project by Project.  Property by Property by Property. &#x20;
