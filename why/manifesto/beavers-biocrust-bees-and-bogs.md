# ðŸ¦« Beavers, Biocrust, Bees & Bogs

Don't get us wrong.  Trees are cool.  And so is Regenerative Ag.  But these two will not solve or stop climate change.  They will help for sure, but are only a part of the puzzle.

Basin looks for the [levers](buttons-knobs-and-levers.md).  What lever if pulled makes an outsized impact?

The answers are often contrarian.  When society says plant trees, we say "restore the beavers"! When politicians say "drain the swamp", we say "fill up the bogs"!

Beavers, Biocrust, Bees & Bogs are just some examples of climate levers that have outsized impacts.  Others include peatlands, mangroves, underground biomass, whale carbon, floodplains, deserts, algae.  [This](../../how/strategy/projects.md) is where Basin excels.
