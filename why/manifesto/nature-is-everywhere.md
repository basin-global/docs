# ðŸªµ Nature is Everywhere

Look around you.  Nature is everywhere. &#x20;

Not just the trees, the grass, the birds, the deer or the insects.  Look at your clothes.  Your food.  Your desk or countertop.  Your car.  Your home.  The glass you look through and the phone you look at.  This is all nature.  It came from nature, is nature and will return to nature.

And Nature is not just wilderness.  It is your yard.  The City park.  The beach.  The lake.  Even the golf course.&#x20;

Nature is not separate of us.  Humans are part of nature.

The more we remember this connection, the more we [value nature](../../how/revenue-models/natural-capital/).
