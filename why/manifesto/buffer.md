# â˜‚ Buffer

Wiggle Room.  Margin for Error.  Buffer.

We humans try to fit everything into boxes: a taxonomy for this, a nomenclature for that.  Correlated or Uncorrelated?  We don't know.

There is lots of room for error in Carbon and Natural Capital.

Worried about additionality?  Permanence?  A "unit" of biodiversity?  Species drift?&#x20;

If so, build in a buffer.  Remove more carbon, plant more trees, restore more land than we think we need to.  Kill less animals.  Save for Rainy Day.

With a buffer we can do more and argue less.
