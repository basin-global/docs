# ðŸŽ› Buttons, Knobs & Levers

Regenerative Finance focuses on three things:

1. builds products, services and organizations that regenerate rather than extract from earth and people.  Regenerative goes beyond sustainable to create positive reinforcing value loops.
2. like an ecological pyramid, energy (money) circulates through the system to do more of #1.  Flow, rather than accumulation is the goal.
3. uses interoperable and composable tools to do #1 and #2.

What if solving the climate, nature and social crises was a simple as having a control panel that with a push of a button, turn of a knob or slide of a lever could adjust the inputs and outputs of the system?  What if, in most cases, the control panel made those adjustments automatically?

Too much carbon?

```
while( CO2 > 300 ppm) 
{
remove CO2;
}
```

Same could go for biodiversity loss, income inequality, air quality, water quality.

Yes, Utopian for sure.  But this is the vision of ReFi.

Interoperable and Composable systems with incentives baked in.  Incentivize more of what we want and less of what we don't.

Money Legos.  Climate Legos.  Nature Legos.

Building a beautiful future that is partially automated is now possible.
