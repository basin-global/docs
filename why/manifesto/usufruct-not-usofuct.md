# üîù Usufruct not Usofuct

Usofuct is what we will all be if we don't figure out how to solve the climate and nature crises.

All kidding aside, usufruct is a tool to help us.

Usufruct is a limited real right found in civil-law and mixed jurisdictions that unites the two property interests of usus and fructus:

* Usus (use) is the right to use or enjoy a thing possessed, directly and without altering it.
* Fructus (fruit) is the right to derive profit from a thing possessed.

Basically, usufruct is the right to enjoy the use and advantages of another's property short of the destruction or waste of its substance.

If done correctly, separating out the use of a property and the property itself it creates a world of mutually beneficial outcomes and financing mechanisms to restore and conserve ecosystems and carbon sinks. &#x20;
