# ðŸ’Ž Nothing is Permanent

We get that in any given carbon removal, the length of that removal matters.  But stop calling it permanence.

Nothing is permanent.  We humans like to think we are permanent.  But ask the dinosaurs that we burn for fuel.  Or the plants and animals that humans have already made extinct.  How did that permanence go for them?  There is a reason this period is called the Anthropocene.  It is a period and ends in a period.

The only thing permanent are the cycles of change and change itself.

Want permanent carbon removal?  Remove it year by year by year in perpetuity (or as long as we can).  Just like photosynthesis has been doing for 3 billion years.&#x20;

[Tonne years](../../how/revenue-models/carbon/) make sense.  They allow for comparison of different carbon removal types and incentivize perpetual carbon sink restoration and stewardship.
