# 🌡 Everything is Additional

Additionality is commonly defined as "_the reductions in emissions achieved by a project must be “above business as usual” and they would not have happened unless the project was implemented as a result of carbon financing_".&#x20;

Under this scenario project developers must prove their project is additional and that carbon finance either prevented emissions or added new removals.&#x20;

This is nice position to take.  If it was 1990.

In a 420+ PPM world contemplating 1.5 to 2+°C baked in warming that can’t really be mitigated, every carbon removal activity is additional. &#x20;

**Unless both legally protected and stewarded in-fact, every ecosystem and carbon sink is threatened and at risk and therefore additional.**
