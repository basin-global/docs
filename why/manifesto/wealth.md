# ðŸ’° Wealth

Historically the word "wealth" meant "_well-being, health, happiness, prosperity and preservation_".&#x20;

Money and financial wealth was a byproduct and not the focus.

Whether it be by _Sacred Economics_, _The Soul of Money_, _Inclusive Wealth_ or the _8 Forms of Capital_ we need to sort out our relationship to money, what is is and what it means.

Do you want your money, your wealth, backed by sea shells, tulips, slaves (god forbid), coal or oil?&#x20;

Or maybe electricity?  How about money backed by ecological health?

In $BASIN, real wealth is functioning and thriving ecosystems, clean air and water, human health and well-being created from a system where the individual prospers and the collective flourishes.
