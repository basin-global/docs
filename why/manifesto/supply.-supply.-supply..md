# 🏗 Supply. Supply. Supply.

All the hype around the carbon markets and investment in them is great.  But infrastructure without supply is like pipes without water or train tracks without trains.  Without supply, the infrastructure does little good.

Basin is focused on: Supply. Supply. Supply. &#x20;

Not just the supply of carbon removals but natural capital and impact supply.  Biodiversity.  Clean Air.  Clean Water.  Pollination.  Habitat.  Health.  Well Being and much much more.
