# üßó‚ôÄ Life on the Edge

The edges are where connection takes place.  Whether it be in biology, materials, ecosystems or groups of people.

Edges are the places where the inside and the outside meet.  Edges are where the action (or Interaction!) is.  Where things meet and connect is where the opportunity is.  In nature, Confluences, Estuaries, Deltas, Treelines are all examples of this.

Aldo Leopold noted the edges of ecosystems as the ones most full of life:  ‚Äú_The edge is where things happen._‚Äù&#x20;

Ecotones are ‚Äú_an area or zone of transition between two or more diverse communities_‚Äù.  The transition between two ecosystems are where the greatest diversity and opportunity exist for both flora and fauna.  At the edges, the ecosystems mix and connect.  Some species exist _only_ in ecotones, given the unique environment created by the convergence.

Basin operates at the edges: on one end Restoration and on the other Conservation.  Our Landscape approach connects the edges.  Ecosystem to Ecosystem.  Property by Property by Property.
