# ðŸŒŠ We All Live Downstream

Aspen, CO has a local saying:  "_Downstream from Nobody_".  Sure, there is nobody upstream from Aspen and their water is not human polluted.  But this saying is not true for them just as it is not true for the rest of the world.  While Aspen is downstream from nobody, its water is affected by old mine tailings and is subject to massive water diversion projects.  As much as Aspen lives in a bubble, they don't actually live in a bubble.

In reality we all live downstream from somebody or something.  It is the circular and cyclical nature of the earth's systems.

A good exercises is to ask:  "Where does our water come from?  Where does it go?  Same goes for air.  Food.  Waste. Trash.  Even people or building materials.  Where does it come from and where does it go?

The more we acknowledge that we are part of a larger interconnected and interdependent system, the quicker we will solve the climate and nature crises.
