# âŒ› Buying Time

As they say: Time is Money.

In climate change time is money but also risk of life and livelihoods.

Our friends at [AirMiners](https://airminers.org/) will eventually suck enough carbon out of the atmosphere.  And the likes of Heliogen will provide all the cheap power we could ever want.

But until then, the clock is ticking.  NbS (Nature-based Solutions) buy us time. &#x20;

NbS and Natural Climate Solutions are already proven: Is a 3.8 billion year FDA / FCC trial period good enough?

The [climate.lease](../../what/basin-property-protocol/climate.lease.md) buys us time and builds in [Adaptive Capacity](adaptive-capacity.md). &#x20;
