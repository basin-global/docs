# ðŸ˜¨ Climate FUD to Climate FOMO

Anger.  Depression.  Lethargy.

These are words Basin [Members](../../what/community/network-participants/members.md) have used to express how they felt before joining Basin.

They were feeling Climate FUD.  Fear.  Uncertainty.  Doubt.

Basin is an outlet to action.  Real, on the ground (literally), climate action.

**Basin turns Climate FUD into Climate FOMO.**
