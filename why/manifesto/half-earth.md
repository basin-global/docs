# ðŸŒ— Half-Earth

Biodiversity tends to increase with the area of land or water conserved and intact ecosystems play a major roles in mitigating climate change.  Yet only 16% of global land is in protected areas. In the US, itâ€™s closer to 12%.  In many places in the world it is as low as 7%.

The 30x30 goal set by 50+ countries to conserve 30% of land and water by 2030 is a great start but not enough.  In fact, thereâ€™s no specific scientific basis for 30%.

Estimates from studies considering a wide set of biodiversity values suggest that 30 to 70% of land and water should be under some sort of protection.  The call for 50% of the Earth is a mid-point of these values and is supported by a range of studies.

Conservation does not exclude humans from these areas, it simply focuses on the importance of protecting rich ecosystems before they are bulldozed, drained, deforested, or abandoned. &#x20;

As an example, Marine Protected Areas restore and enhance commercial fisheries in and out of the MPA, provide recreation and tourism income as well as numerous spiritual and cultural values.

> A biogeographic scan of Earthâ€™s principal habitat shows that a full representation of its ecosystems and the vast majority of its species can be saved within half the planetâ€™s surface. At one-half and above, life on Earth enters the safe zone. Within half, existing calculations from existing ecosystems indicate that more than 80 percent of the species would be stabilized.
