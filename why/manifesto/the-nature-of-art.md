# üñº The Nature of Art

Nature is Art.  Art is Nature.

What if we could price Nature like Art?

Why is a [painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_most\_expensive\_paintings) worth $450M?  Value is subjective.

Buffet says: "_**Price is what you pay; value is what you get**._"  Oscar Wilde suggested that markets: ‚Äú_**know the price of everything and the value of nothing**_‚Äù.

Cost.  Price.  Value.  They can all be the same or be wildly different.

It all comes down to story.  The stories we tell eachother and the stories we tell ourselves.
