# ðŸŒŒ Security. Not a Security.

The Howey Test:  Is it a security or not a security?&#x20;

This is the wrong question to be asking.  The world has bigger problems.  Real problems.

Let's talk Security.  Not Securities.

Water Security.  Food Security.  Land Security.  Carbon Security.  Biodiversity Security.  Income Security.

**The Security of Place.  The Security of Practice.**

This, is what we are after.



(_Who is Howey anyway?  And why are we still talking about him?_)
