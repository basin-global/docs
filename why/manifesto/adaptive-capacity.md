The 2021 joint IPBES/IPCC report concludes that most climate solutions are too narrowly focused and should instead be holistic so as to encompass the **climate-biodiversity-society nexus**.

> The ability of a system to adjust to climate variability and extremes in order to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities or to cope with the consequences.

**Basin is built with and has Adaptive Capacity.**
