# âŒ› TL;DR

## One Liner

**basin.global scales real estate restoration and conservation to solve the climate, nature and carbon crises.**

## "**T**oo Long; Didn't Read"

Above all else, basin.global is a rapidly deployable, easily repeatable, exponentially scalable solution to climate change.

As regenerative finance for real estate based climate, nature and carbon projects the Basin platform facilitates the acquisition and stewardship of undervalued / degraded property and regenerates it for economic and environmental benefit.&#x20;

The [$BASIN ReFi Mechanism](what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/) uses property restoration and network climate project activity to fund conservation in support of the natural capital of the global Commons in perpetuity.

The [Basin Property Protocol](what/basin-property-protocol/):

* identifies both degraded/ undervalued and pristine / threatened properties
* evaluates them for climate impact, financial feasibility and Higher & Better Use
* onboards select properties and property rights at the lowest cost
* connects all the tools and resources needed for climate project and holistic real estate development

Using the Basin toolset, our diverse multidisciplinary community creates transdisciplinary results by making the world's largest problems investable.&#x20;

basin.global is stakeholder owned, polycentric governed and is operated in accordance with our WHY, Core Values, Key Principles and Covenants.

$BASIN accounts for all that is valuable and needed in the world but is unpriced:  $STREAMS fill $BASIN's to reflect this value.
