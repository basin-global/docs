# How to use $BASIN

Basin is under development and in private beta.  As a ground up movement we welcome your involvement. &#x20;

The best places to start are [basin-property-protocol](../what/basin-property-protocol/ "mention") and [usdbasin-refi-mechanism](../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/ "mention").

Our community has grown to over 2,000 people and we are seeking more pilot projects, looking to grow the community and partnerships and looking for talented developers and programmers.  We always appreciate frank feedback, constructive criticism, helpful advice and meaningful contribution.&#x20;

We have real on the ground pilot projects going with Land Trusts, private property owners, city governments and Fortune 500 corporations.  Although we have raised non-dilutive funding and have private investment, fundraising is ongoing.  We welcome you to get [involved](../quick-links/official-links.md), join the [community](https://discord.gg/basinglobal), [donate](../quick-links/donate.md) and [invest](../quick-links/invest.md).

We expect the first $BASIN's to be minted late 2022 or early 2023 and $STREAMS to flow thereafter.   We are targeting a November 2023 for a comprehensive public release.
