# How Basin Works

As a solution to climate change, $BASIN is designed to incentivize the restoration and conservation of ecosystems in perpetuity.&#x20;

The more network activity, the more ecosystems and carbon sinks (properties) that are restored, regenerated and conserved.&#x20;

## Climate Projects, Properties & Protocol

The Basin [Strategy](../how/strategy/), [Business](../how/business-model/) and [Revenue](../how/revenue-models/) models use the [Basin Property Protocol](../how/strategy/protocol.md) to create, deploy and scale real estate based climate, nature and carbon projects.

The Basin Property Protocol identifies, evaluates, onboards [properties](../how/strategy/properties.md) and connects them to the [people](../how/strategy/people.md) and tools to create successful financially feasible climate [projects](../how/strategy/projects.md).&#x20;

The [basinStack](../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md) uncovers hidden value, accounts for this value and provides a connection point to those who want to share in that value via ReFi.  The [climate.lease](../what/basin-property-protocol/climate.lease.md) is a core component of the [Basin HoldCo OpCo PropCo](../how/business-model/holdco-opco-propco/) model and is designed to attract agnostic and indifferent capital to the climate and nature space which buys society time while creating financial yields.

## Tributaries & Confluences

Basin is made up Tributaries & Confluences.

[Tributaries](../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/tributaries.md) are the Basin branded HoldCo, OpCo's and PropCo's that operate key parts of the protocol **and** are climate, carbon and nature real estate project joint ventures.  Tributary cash flow and value accrues to $BASIN [Members](../what/community/network-participants/members.md) prorata

[Confluences](../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/confluences.md) are independent network participants who provide key products and services to the network **and** are the connection points to other ReFi mechanisms.  Confluence members interact with the network using the [basinSwap](../how/revenue-models/sales-and-swaps.md) related to their products, services, projects and properties.

Basin Tributaries & Confluences use existing real world legal, financial and operational frameworks in conjunction with web3, DeFi and ReFi tools for speed, impact and flexibility.

### Three Rivers

The [Basin Trust](broken-reference) is an permanent evergreen holding company structured as a Perpetual Purpose Trust.  The Basin Trust mandate is to steward ecosystem services and the benefits nature provides to and for all living creatures, both present and future.&#x20;

The [Basin Foundation](broken-reference) is a Trustee of the Trust and is also the Trust Enforcer.  The Foundation provides low to no cost real estate onboarding, methodologies, education and manages the geolocation of $BASIN's and represents the Rights of Nature.  $STREAMS are approved and minted by the Foundation.

[BasinDAO](broken-reference) is Member managed and steers the direction of basin.global and is also Trustee of the Trust.  OpCo's and PropCo's are proposed from within basinDAO and approved as $BASIN's.

The Trust, Foundation and DAO steward basin.global and collectively maintain and manage the Protocol and $[BASIN ReFi Mechanism](../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/).

## $STREAMS fill $BASIN's

As a legacy asset, $BASIN is designed to create shared upside and reduced risk for ALL of nature and people. &#x20;

The value of $BASIN is representative of increased positive externalities, reduced negative externalities and reflective of the general health of our planet and society.   $BASIN is governance, utility, access, cash flow and store of value in all that is basin.global.

As vessels, $BASIN's are "Treasuries of Treasures": clean air, clean water, biodiversity, functioning & thriving ecosystems, and human health and well being all derived from and built on natural and human capital and real assets and equated to financial capital. &#x20;

$STREAMS fill $BASIN's and, as unit of account, equate to the natural capital and human capital of Basin Projects and Properties above and beyond the "commonly accepted value" (IRL/meatspace) of the underlying real assets.  $STREAMS is designed to represent the unpriced value of ecosystem services and natural asset accounts as well as the inherent and intrinsic value of art and culture and even meme value.

As a polycentric DAO, $BASIN governs both basinDAO (1:1 democratically) and the Basin Trust (via conviction related to staked $STREAMS).&#x20;

$BASIN is (currently) free to mint and designed for multi-stakeholder engagement with local stakeholders and Rights of Nature included by design.  $BASIN has several "layer-ups" that add value and $STREAMS to each $BASIN.

## **Interoperable Composable Organization**

As an organization, Basin is fluid.  The structure itself is interoperable and composable and uses business, finance, philanthropy, law, technology and art to create an environment where the individual prospers and the collective, including nature, flourishes. &#x20;
