# "basin"

## Analogy

The word "basin" comes from the Latin word "bacca": a water vessel.  Vessel originated in French as "container".

In geography, a basin is a dip, usually a bowl shape, in the Earth's surface.  A basin's sides may dip gently or steeply, but their bottoms are always wider than they are deep.

Basins are where land and water are ecologically linked in a natural system.  Basin is used around the world to describe a watershed.  Basins and watersheds are akin to ecoregions and bioregions.

A catchment basin is an area of land where all flowing water converges to a single point.  A basin may consist of smaller basins that merge at river confluences from tributaries, forming a hierarchical nested system.

Basins are important in ecology and provide humans with ecosystem services such as storage and filtration.  Basins store water as a resource for humans and nature alike.  As water flows over, through and under land it picks up nutrients, sediment, and pollutants which basins filter.  Streams flowing into basins often fill their floors with sediments which forms strata in geology.

## In Practice

basin.global is designed to operate like the water cycle operates in watersheds as an ecosystem of interrelated and interdependent basins. &#x20;

$BASIN's are a vessel that circulate and store value.  $BASIN's are containers full of both a) precious treasures like clean air, clean water, biodiversity, carbon removal and all else that is valuable but not adequately priced by the market and b) commonly accepted and priced assets like currency, real estate and art. &#x20;

$STREAMS fill $BASIN's.  [$BASIN](../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tokenomics/) catches and stores value for you, your family, your community and society.&#x20;

We are excited to have you [onboard](../quick-links/official-links.md) the Basin expedition to explore the flow of environmental and financial value.  Please keep this analogy in mind as you "flow" through the Basin.
