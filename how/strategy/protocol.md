# Protocol

## Scaling Climate Projects

Projects are done by [People](people.md) on [Properties](properties.md). &#x20;

But how do we organize all of this?

### Climate is a Coordination Problem

Not much has changed since the UN [voiced](https://unfccc.int/news/un-says-unprecedented-coordination-needed-to-tackle-climate-and-disaster-risks) "_Unprecedented Coordination Needed to Tackle Climate and Disaster Risks_".  If anything it has gotten worse.  Too many Silos and Factions.

**We need to coordinate.  Better. Faster. Together.**

## Coordination Protocol

Protocol means different things to different people.

The word protocol came from the Greek prefix prōto- ("first") and the noun kolla ("glue"), prōtokollon.

Hmmm... _First Glue?_ Maybe an interpretation is: what to do, first.  And then: where to stick it or how to make it stick.

Protocol [transitioned](https://www.etymonline.com/word/protocol) from Latin and French from "rough draft; original copy of a treaty" to "official record of a transaction", to "diplomatic document" (**especially one signed by friendly powers to secure certain ends by peaceful means**), and finally, in French, to "formula of diplomatic etiquette."&#x20;

Varied, simpler definitions of protocol are:

* a detailed plan
* a system of rules that explain the correct conduct and procedures to be followed
* a set of conventions governing the treatment and especially the formatting of data in an electronic communications system
* rules the define the interface of a network; interaction between the computers, incentives, kind of data, etc

### Humans, Nature & Technology

Climate change appears to be human induced.  And therefore needs to be human solved. Computers won't solve it for us.  Nature won't solve it for us. &#x20;

Humans working in concert with nature and technology will.

## Real Property Protocol

As [discussed](../../why/opportunity/real-estate.md), in our view land and land use is a major component of solving climate change, removing carbon and restoring nature.  Underneath All is the Land.

What if there was a protocol for the Higher and Better Use of real estate?  Not just the highest economic use but environmental and social as well?

Now there is.

As originally [proposed](https://twitter.com/tmoindustries/status/1463536915446173706?s=20\&t=A5VGtBBQl1MkuW8fsbFr1Q), "basin.protocol" was an open source project to facilitate multi-stakeholder real assets on chain for transparent long term governance, operation, funding and composable interchain connectivity for layered property rights.

Over the last year this has evolved to align more with Basin's vision rather than being a one size fits all, for all types of property.  With a focus on climate solutions, the restoration and conservation of ecosystems, the $BASIN Property Protocol has taken shape.

The $BASIN Property Protocol connects properties and people to create, deploy and scale climate impact projects.  At its core, it is a coordination tool.

More details can be found in the [$BASIN Property Protocol](../../what/basin-property-protocol/) section but at the 30,000 feet level the Basin Protocol is a set of processes that people use in conjunction with interoperable and composable ReFi technologies to connect properties to all that is needed to create large scale climate impact.

**A way to think of it is the "real estate layer" for climate, nature and carbon projects.**
