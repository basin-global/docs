# Projects

## Climate Solutions

To solve the [Crises](../../why/crises/), we need more climate projects.  Pronto.

We need to reduce and remove as much as carbon as possible while restoring and conserving nature.

What are our biggest levers? What kinds of projects make the biggest impact?

This is what Basin set out to solve.

## Project Types

Forests and regenerative agriculture are en vogue and "cool".  Rightfully so.  They cover huge amounts of land and hold much potential impact for carbon and natural capital assets.

However these are “shiny objects”.

We will work on and support forestry and regenerative agriculture but see extensive opportunities in all of real estate.  Frankly, the opportunities for climate mitigation and adaptation and nature positive projects using real estate are almost endless.  **Every property is a climate property.**

We take a holistic “ecosystem + carbon” approach which focuses on restoring and conserving carbon sinks as well as avoided real estate related emissions.  This holistic approach maximizes value creation using a full stack of methods to make projects financially feasible.

These projects can be grouped into the natural climate solutions (NCS) or nature based solutions (NbS) categories but also cross over into the built environment including buildings and infrastructure.

## Project Models & Methodologies

These project models are all under development in Basin and are open to use via license. We are creating, working with partners and/or Registries for methodologies for these types of projects.

## Why These Climate Projects Matter

Here are a few highlights from our in-depth research that show the size of and importance of the ecosystem + carbon opportunity as well as potential interventions. Almost all need access to and happen on land / real estate.

* More than 75 percent of Earth’s land areas are substantially degraded, undermining the well-being of 3.2 billion people. These lands that have become deserts, polluted or have been deforested and converted to other uses are also the main causes of species extinctions. If this trend continues, 95 percent of the Earth’s land areas could become degraded by 2050.
* Ending land degradation and restoring degraded land would get humanity one third of the way to keeping global warming below 2°C, the target climate scientists say we need to avoid the most devastating impacts.
* Deforestation alone accounts for 10% of all human-induced emissions.
* Ecosystem & land restoration categories have the highest potential for carbon removal: 2.9 gigatons annually.
* Up to 61% of global building emissions could be cut by 2050 with the right interventions.
* Wetlands have been hit the hardest, with 87% lost globally in the last 300 years. Approximately 54% have been lost since 1900. Wetlands also help reduce disaster risk, as they mitigate floods and protect coastlines. Despite their essential role in global climate regulation, wetlands remain undervalued by policy and decision-makers in national plans.
* Peatlands may only cover 3 percent of the world’s land, but they hold nearly 30 percent of its soil carbon and store twice as much carbon as forests, playing a pivotal role in delivering global commitments on climate change, sustainable development and biodiversity.
* Pound for pound, mangroves can sequester four times more carbon than rainforests can.
* Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere and 1 kg of CH4 is about equivalent to releasing 84 kg of CO2. There are over 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells in the US alone emitting the equivalent of 7.8M tonnes of CO2e per year. And there are approximately 100 abandoned coal mines that leak the equivalent of almost 3M tonnes of CO2e per year.
* Adding water to a degraded semi-arid floodplain wetland reduces carbon emissions by 28–84%.
* Algae, when used in conjunction with bioreactors, is up to 400 times more efficient than a tree at removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
* Biological soil crusts cover approximately 12% of the worlds surfaces and are a key ecological component across many arid and semi-arid regions regarding biodiversity, ecosystem functions and carbon sequestration.
* Arid regions, which cover about 47% of the earth’s land mass, are thought to make up the world’s third-largest carbon sink on land. Closed, or endorheic, basins in deserts — areas into which water flows but doesn’t flow out — are significant storehouses of carbon. As the world warms these are all under threat.
* Beaver meadows store substantial organic carbon along streams and rivers as well as provide other ecosystem services such as biodiversity, habitat, and flood and fire protection. Abandonment and degradation of beaver meadows substantially decreases carbon storage and the other positive climate services beavers provide.
* Urban Nature Based Solutions: More and more municipalities are replacing ‘gray’ with ‘green’ infrastructure by creating parks, restoring urban lakes and streams, such measures protect against flooding, heatwaves and disease and improve well-being of people. Ecotones and the urban edges are key to biodiversity.
* we have dozens more in Basin Roam and Notion

## Climate Project Development

The [Basin Property Protocol](protocol.md) helps determine which projects could or should be developed where as well as what stakeholders should participate.

### What do we need to deploy these climate projects?

As NCS or NbS, these projects all need land or real estate.  They also need people and a process.

Up next, [Properties](properties.md).....
