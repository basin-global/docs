## Scaling Climate, Nature & Carbon Projects

With the intent to be a core solution to climate change, we asked ourselves:

_How do we scale climate, nature and carbon projects?_

The answer:&#x20;

_**Provide and connect everything a project developer would need or want to develop and repeat successful climate projects.**_

## Climate Project Development

We define a climate project as any organization, business, property, product or service that aims to solve climate change and the interconnected problems of climate mitigation and adaptation, nature loss, carbon removal and climate and environmental justice.

Through our lens, almost every type of climate project uses or will interface at some point with real estate. Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) and Nature-based Solutions (NbS) happen on or near land and can't exist unless the projects have legal access to and across land.

### Project Developer Needs

Based on research, projects developers need or want the following, including but not limited to:

| <p>Risk reduction<br>Best practices<br>Increased opportunity<br>More projects<br>Property rights<br>Properties<br>Streaming &#x26; Use </p><p>Financial Models<br>Debt &#x26; Equity<br>Sinking funds<br>Financing<br>Methodologies<br>On-chain / Off-chain options<br>Registry assistance &#x26; selection<br>Marketplaces</p> | <p>Buyers<br>Off-takes &#x26; Ex-Ante sales </p><p>MRV, IoT, Remote Sensing</p><p>Data<br>Marketing &#x26; Storytelling</p><p>Real estate services<br>Insurance<br>Vendors<br>Mapping/GIS<br>People, skills, expertise, etc<br>High level guidance &#x26; advice<br>Intel &#x26; market pricing data </p><p>Legal<br>On the ground execution </p><p>Shared upside</p> |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

We will go into these needs and wants more in detail in the Projects, Properties, People and Protocol sections but it is worth noting several high level design features first.

## Adaptive Capacity

Everything in Basin is designed to have Adaptive Capacity.

IPBES/IPCC defines Adaptive Capacity as “The ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences.” The Basin platform and network is a toolbox and hybrid-organizational approach for solving the giant systemic problems of climate change and nature loss.

The dual crises of Climate Change and Biodiversity / Ecosystem degradation are inextricably linked and must be considered together. Basin emphasizes integrated solutions and considers the climate-biodiversity-social system a "nexus" that should be dealt with from a social-ecological systems perspective. Basin is focused on interoperability and composability across technology, legal, finance and social systems.

## Investable

The key to solving climate change is incentivizing capital markets. Unfortunately Policy and Philanthropy are only going to get us so far. Business, Industry and Finance is what got us into this mess and will need to get us out. The self serving nature of Capitalism is actually a tool we can use. By changing and using Business as a tool, we might have a fighting chance to solve the climate and nature crises.

If we make climate projects investable, with the right risk and return profiles, we can attract and use indifferent and agnostic capital to our advantage. $BASIN is built to be investable at both the network level and the project/property level. Investors can have their cake and eat it too.

### Real Estate

Like it or not, carbon, natural capital, biodiversity and ecosystem services are all derived in one way or another from real estate (with the exception of large bodies of water).

Underneath All is the Land: the earth, ecosystems, carbon sinks, nature. With human construct and law put on this, it becomes real estate, real property, real assets.

We assert that real estate use, ownership, investment and development and land use is key to solving the climate and nature crises and everything we do is based on this.

### Carbon is a subset of Natural Capital

A key part of our Manifesto is that Carbon is a Co-benefit of functioning and thriving ecosystems. Carbon is a byproduct and the carbon markets are a tool to restore, regenerate and conserve nature.

We predict that the demand for carbon is not and will not be an issue. Nor will carbon market infrastructure be a problem. The Basin model is focused on creating the most "supply" in the shortest time at the lowest cost.

Carbon is just a means to an end and that natural capital, “nature investment”, “biodiversity investment” and “financing for nature” is or will become larger markets than carbon as most of our economy is highly dependent on nature. Negative externalities are not currently priced into the global economy but will soon be by means of upcoming required governmental and institutional climate and nature related disclosures and natural capital accounting methods. Basin will be at the center of this market and societal paradigm shift.

### Value of Story

Value is a human construct.

Look at needs and wants. What does it cost? What is the price? What is the value? These three numbers can be different and usually are different depending on who or where you are.

A main part of Basin’s vision is to price what is valuable. Not for the sake of economics or business but as a means to protect and steward ecosystems and biodiversity.

If biodiversity were not free and instead treated like the asset it is, we would not have the biodiversity crisis. If carbon (basically trash or waste) was priced based on its negative effects we would not have the carbon removal crisis.

And of course not all things can or should be priced. This is the intrinsic value, inherent value or the value of uniqueness and non-fungibility.

We call this the art value, the story value or meme value. We are working to tell a better story of why something is valuable as a shared construct. Our goal is to express the value of the priceless.

### Purposeful Practicality

Mixing positive impact and profits is hard. This is why the two have historically been separate. The right hand extracts and the left hand repairs. The thing is though: we need all hands on deck. The Basin strategy and business model balances purpose and impact with practicality and reality.

## Platform / Network / Protocol

In the spirit of composability and interoperability, and rather than creating everything ourselves, the platform, network and protocol models are the best option for speed and scale.

Our financial and operational models are based on this “platform model” as a HoldCo with a series of interrelated but independent OpCo's and PropCo's.

As a protocol, network participants have the ability to build on top of and iterate on Basin to maximize their own success while reducing risk.

### Vertical Approach

The Basin network connects, creates and provides all needed services and tools that projects and project developers need or want while creating an environment to build better, more efficient, impactful and profitable projects.

## Collaboration

At the core of our model is the assumption that sharing and collaboration are what is needed to solve the climate crisis.

The open source nature of Basin provides opportunities for project developers and stakeholders to take immediate advantage of the multi-trillion dollar market opportunity that is climate change while simultaneously making huge positive impacts.

Nonprofits and philanthropic initiatives can use basin.global in or outside of the Basin network. For-profit endeavors have flexible options to use Basin tools and services as long as they are operating within the network. (See License) Regardless of for profit or not for profit, the incentives of in-network activity far outweigh operating outside the network.

Basin takes this saying further: “_if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together_” and allows us to do both. basin.global is a way for both the individual and collective to go fast and far at the same time.

In Basin “_the whole is greater than the sum of its parts_”.

### Individual and Collective

Sharing and collaboration does not forsake the individual over the collective. In our opinion, a little dose of competition makes individuals perform better which increases the overall performance of the group.

The $BASIN Regenerative Finance Mechanism creates a circular value exchange whereby collective success is only possible if individuals are successful and vice versa.

In Basin, individuals prosper while the collective flourishes.

As the saying goes, "A rising tide lifts all boats."

## Under the hood

When we want to go somewhere, literally **go** somewhere, we mainly care about reliability, safety, timeliness and comfort. Maybe speed and style. Do we drive a car? Take the bus? A plane and train? Walk?

For the most part, we just want to know we will get there on time, safely and comfortably. Or maybe even have some fun along the way by going fast, while looking cool.

In either case, do you need to know "what is under the hood"? What type of engine and technology? All the logistics it took to get you there? How all the parts fit together and why they look the way they do?

No. You just want to get there. But if you DO want to see and understand all the details it is very easy to look under the hood or read the manual.

Basin is no different. For the most part, we just need to know we will solve climate change faster in better ways. If you want to look under the hood, no problem. Come take a look. There is nothing scary about tokens and blockchain.

### New-School

A key Basin assumption is that the current systems and existing models are not fully adequate to meet the climate-nature-social challenge and that new ways of doing things are imperative.

Basin combines the best of what works from the traditional system and markets with “new-school” decentralized web3 tools and regenerative finance models that operate for stakeholders, not just shareholders.

As a polycentric DAO, basin.global is fluid and adaptable but coordinated. DAO's aim to move like a school of fish, flock of birds, a hive, a swarm, or a colony. Through mutual trust and respect, we operate with general consensus for speed and efficiency to create and deploy urgently needed climate solutions.

### TradFi DeFi ReFi

What is the best tool for the job? The tools at hand.

Basin uses all tools available to create, deploy, repeat and scale climate projects. We use the best of Traditional Finance (TradFi), Law and other legacy systems and combine with the more recent tools of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to build new and future tools that will be a part of Regenerative Finance (ReFi).

### The Future

If you really want to see the future, check out [Hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) and [Network States](https://thenetworkstate.com/).  While Basin's current intent is not to be a Hyperstructure or Network State alone, we do see ourselves connecting to and being a part of these movements.

## Projects, Properties, People & Protocol

So....how do we make the biggest climate impact?

By creating effective yet investable climate, nature and carbon projects that are multi-stakeholder driven.

At the core of the Basin model is that projects sit on properties. Properties includes carbon sinks, ecosystems and buildings wether they be degraded/underutilized or pristine/threatened. These projects and properties need to be connected to people and resources to maximize environmental and financial impact.

To this end we need:

* as many **projects** as possible
* **properties** that the projects operate on
* **people** who have the skills and resources to make it happen
* a **protocol** to assemble all the pieces to deploy, repeat and scale
