# Properties

## Climate Properties

Projects need Properties.

Of all the things a climate project developer needs and wants, properties to do projects on is at the center.

It is hard, if not impossible, to do a legitimate climate project without property or property rights.

Sourcing and evaluation of properties is one of our core competencies. Much of our work is centered around how to onboard as many properties and property rights as possible for climate projects at the lowest cost .

In our view, any property can be a climate property. More properties and projects equals more Supply and Impact.

However first we need to zoom out.

## Private Property: The Tragedy of the Commons

These two quotes express the contradiction we currently face:

> “How can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them from us?”

_1854, Chief Seattle to the US Government_&#x20;

> “Buy land, they're not making it anymore.”

_Mark Twain_

We will spare you the whole debate about the Tragedy of Commons, why it is false and that private property laws are at the root of many of the problems the world faces.

See: Nobel Prize in Economics - Elinor Ostrom "[Non-Tragedy of the Commons](https://wle.cgiar.org/news/elinor-ostrom-%E2%80%9Cnon-tragedy-commons%E2%80%9D)" and the fantastic New Yorker essay "[The Theft of the Commons](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/essay/the-theft-of-the-commons)"
{% endhint %}

An entire legal history can be ascertained in the four lines of an anonymous English poem:

> _The law locks up the man or woman_&#x20;
>
> _Who steals the goose from off the common,_&#x20;
>
> _But lets the greater villain loose_&#x20;
>
> _Who steals the common from the goose._

Ideally the Commons would be just that: Common to everyone.

However our world economic and legal systems are not set up to adequately provide for and protect the Commons. Sure there are national parks and protected areas but the world economy has been built for extraction and commoditization of our natural resources. ReCommoning is necessary.

### Ecosystem Services & Real Property

As Commons, Ecosystem Services are defined as “nature’s contributions to people”. Like it or not, in the human based legal system, ecosystem services move through and natural resources are derived from real estate or real property. With the exception of large bodies of water, navigable rivers and the atmosphere, all of the natural resources can be "owned" in one way or another, either privately or by government (which is supposed to be public ownership but often is not).

The value of ecosystem services and contributions to people are not priced into our financial system. But they urgently need to be. Real estate values can and should reflect these "services".

Real property, while capital intensive, is also capital attractive. Under long standing customs and rule of law in most jurisdictions, real assets can easily be bought, sold, financed, leased and freely utilized.

We are currently witnessing the beginning of a surge of property turnover that will alter the future of natural resources around the world. Even as most experts say we need to protect 30% to 50% of the land and water, only a fraction actually is. As baby boomers transfer assets and farmers retire, significant property holdings will change hands. This transition is a critical window of opportunity to protect, restore, and rematriate private lands and the natural capital they contain.

We can't wait for a new Commons or real estate system to be built. We have to act now and use the existing systems to restore and steward ecosystems and our natural assets.

## Real Estate Fundamentals

Our property strategy is based on decades of real estate experience.  All strategies are based on making climate projects financially feasible while putting properties to "higher and better use".

### You make your money when you buy.

If you ask most people how someone makes money in real estate, they will most likely sale "sell for a profit".  But sale prices are based on market conditions and waiting for the market price to increase is gambling. Profits are only truly possible based on cost or what was paid. "You make your money when you buy" comes from the adage that if a property is worth $2M and you buy for a $2M, you have to either add value to the property or speculate on prices going up. Instead, if you are able to buy that property for $1.8M even though it is worth a $2M, your gain is already baked in. IF you sell it for $2.2M, even better. This happens in real estate all the time as markets lack transparency and are inefficient.

### Income drives value.

Commercial and investment real estate is valued based on the net income it produces. It might cost $1.5M to build or develop a property. That property vacant may only be worth $1M even though it cost $1.5M to build. If that same property is rented and has stable net income, it could easily be worth $2M. If structured correctly, carbon, natural capital and holistic land use will produce income to drive value.

### Add Value.

Value is often times set by the market or is in the eyes of the beholder. But value can also be created via active strategies and information asymmetry.

### The deal speaks for itself.

We will cover this more in the expense section but in investment real estate "the numbers do the talking". One famous quote says "I don't pay for upside and potential". Investors buy the deals based on the market price today relative to comparable properties and the amount of current net income. Is the deal "Investable"?

### Good deals find good money.

If the numbers work at the property level, the market level and the investor/buyer level then equity and debt is readily available. Global capital markets are actually our friend.

## Property Types

A unique part of Basin is that our model takes environmental and societal land use problems and combines them with commonly used real estate and capital market mechanisms to create desired climate outcomes.

Any property can connect to the Basin Property Protocol and more details can be found there but here is a sampling of our property onboarding:

* Rundown / Deteriorated Property
* Beautiful Pristine or Threatened Property
* Brownfield & Superfund Sites
* Abandoned/Vacant/Blighted Properties
* Stranded assets
* Surplus and excess property
* Sale-leasebacks
* Basin Foundation: real estate donations
* JV/Streaming model
* Motivated Sellers
* Driving for Dollars / Scrolling for Dollars / Scout Program
* Disaster Areas
* Title V of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act
* Functionally Obsolete Buildings
* And of course, on market / for sale / for lease properties

## Financial Feasibility

Financial Feasibility is a core tenent of real estate valuation.

Originally Basin was created for Conservation Finance but we quickly realized the "numbers did't work". Without a “business use” many properties that need restoration or conservation do not pencil. However, our model combines multiple “business uses” to make projects financially feasible.

A useful way to think of the Basin real estate model is similar to that of a “Master Planned Community” where all the potential land uses of a property are evaluated and then laid out and platted as a PUD. However, in our case, instead of the main business uses being commercial, retail, industrial, residential or community etc the main use is climate impact which includes ecosystem services and carbon in addition to other land uses for people. We then combine these uses with multiple income streams, cost reductions and/or tax incentives.

## The Capital Stack

In real estate finance, the term capital stack is commonly used but typically refers to financial capital only. The basinStack looks at other types of capital in addition to financial capital, primarily natural capital and social capital.

The basinStack is our holistic assessment tool and methodology that can be applied to any type of property. The basinStack looks at any property from a “value add” perspective as to how to make a property financially feasible for climate, carbon or nature projects. We assess all traditional “highest and best” uses but more so look for the “higher and better” use of any given property.

The Basin Property Protocol uses the basinStack to assess everything from carbon, biodiversity, climate resilience (i.e. flood and wildfire risk), zoning, existing use, highest and best use, mineral rights, surface rights, regional comparisons, restoration potential, conservation value and much much more to assess the "Value Add".

The basinStack assesses what value exists in a property but is not yet priced. The assessment provides a roadmap to “add-value” to each property with both tangible methods (ie sub-division, leasing, redevelopment, ecocredit sales) but also intangibles such as storytelling, media, PR and even art value (think Sothebys, Masterworks, Banksy, Constitution DAO etc).

This process makes climate projects financially feasibly through value and price gap arbitrage. This is not dissimilar from a traditional value add apartment, retail or industrial real estate developer; we just have a different business use case: climate and social impact using carbon and natural capital.

### Property Scouts

The coordination function of web3, the DAO and the inherent “swarm” behavior is used to source deals market by market (basin to basin). This is our way of “birddogging” or “driving for dollars” as we say in commercial and investment real estate. See [Protocol](../../what/basin-property-protocol/) for more details.

## Restoration to fund Conservation

While the Basin model is set up for eventual conservation of generational “trophy” properties, the real opportunity is in land restoration.

More than 75 percent of Earth’s land areas are substantially degraded, undermining the well-being of 3.2 billion people. Fortunately, the IPCC ecosystem restoration categories have the highest potential for net emission reductions: 2.9 GtCO2e annually. But in fact, land restoration has the least amount of capital flowing to it.

### Functional Obsolescence

The Basin model is not just for land.  It works for any type of real estate.&#x20;

With energy usage alone, up to 61% of global building emissions could be cut by 2050.  Bloomberg estimates that $2.2T worth of commercial buildings are or will become obsolete.  This does not even factor in climate risk from flooding or wildfires which is estimated to be trillions of dollars.

## Funding

A key question we get asked is "how will you fund all this?".

We have dedicated three whole sections to this:  Business Model, Revenue Model and Expenses.

## People and Protocol

Now that we know what [Projects](projects.md) to do and where the Properties are going to come from, how do we do this?
