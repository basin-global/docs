## Nature is a giant Climate Project

Humans are part of Nature but Nature can exist without humans. If we are not careful, nature will go on without us and the Anthropocene will be known not just for what we did to the earth but we did to ourselves (not sure who would be around to read/know that LOL).

The climate projects we envision need people and have people at the center.  People to ideate, create, plan, execute, operate, maintain, steward and whatever else is needed create, deploy, repeat and scale climate, nature and carbon projects.

## Perpetual Stewardship

### Get Paid to Regenerate and Steward the Earth

Want to restore and protect nature and remove carbon?  Pay people to do it.  Day by day, year by year.  This becomes permanence.  Ecosystems provide services to people but we can't actually pay the ecosystems.  But we can pay the people.  The Basin Web3 model allows people to use their unique skills to add value and get paid for it while giving them an outlet for climate FUD (fear, uncertainty & doubt).  Instead of going it alone and taking all the risks themselves they gain a share of 1,000’s of climate projects through $BASIN.  Community contributors primarily want to give their individual gifts to the world by doing important and meaningful work.

## Global Is Local

We are now more connected than ever. Not just via the internet or travel. Events in one place affect things in another place. Whether it be fires in California billowing smoke over five other states, the sands of the Sahara dirtying the Caribbean, a ship stuck in the Suez Canal halting global supply chains, a dry winter in Colorado causing water shortages for millions upon millions of people, industrial agriculture causing mass seaweed blooms 1,000's of miles a way from the source, CO2 levels changing weather across the globe or a bat likely causing a global pandemic, we are all connected.

Ecosystem Services, biodiversity and carbon removal are public goods. They benefit and affect people everywhere.

## Global Starts Local

All climate, nature and carbon projects are local by definition.  Projects and properties are on the ground, literally. They need hands-on care, love and appreciation and sense of place. A project needs both the support of the local people and should help support the local people.

But new media tools allow people across the planet to care and to help from wherever, even if they have never been to a place.  Regardless of where the resources come from, local scales globally as local climate projects benefit other regions and the world.  A project upstream has effects downstream. A tonne of carbon removed from the atmosphere affects us all. Species protected one place prevents a trophic cascade in another place.

## Organizations are People

In the US, Corporations are legally "people" (we use this same rationale and view [Nature as People](../../why/manifesto/personhood.md)).  But really, any type of organization is people. Not the organization itself but what makes it up. The organization is only as good as its people. The people who care, people who want to make change, people who want to use their position and influence to reinvent the system from within.

With an unprecedented effort being needed to slow and reverse global warming we welcome these people and their organizations regardless of size or type. These organizations include but are not limited to business, philanthropy, public corporations, family offices, government, academia, faith based organizations, and of course other DAO’s.

While a certain subset of people may consider this “sleeping with the enemy”, we are open to collaboration with industries that historically have been “more part of the problem than part of the solution”. This includes banks, oil companies, private equity firms, hedge funds, big Ag, big Pharma, insurance companies and mass CPG companies. We welcome the opportunity to work with these groups to collectively “right the ship”.

## It Takes a Village

Implementing climate solutions literally takes village, both a local village and global village. Tech helps source and direct resources to where they are needed most. A global inflow of resources can make or break a local project.  To make climate projects successful we need as many hands, eyes, ears, brains and hearts as possible including but not limited to: technology, law, finance, science, engineering, biology, ecology, surveying, title, MRV, construction, development, maintenance, security, oversight, inspection, policy, IoT, remote sensing, handheld apps, data, diplomacy, accounting, marketing, PR, wisdom, tradition, futurism and more.

### Silos

Climate is too complicated to any one person or one group of people to solve.  Working in silos is kind of like living under a rock.  Sure you can ignore the world around you and do your own thing but this is getting harder and harder with so much codependency across food, finance and materials.  People working in silos will not solve climate change.  Multidisciplinary teams working Interdisciplinarily will create Transdisciplinary results.

### The Power of Partnerships

The Basin model is multi-stakeholder where all parties share in the upside and benefits while minimizing downside.  We aim for the individual to prosper and the collective to flourish.

Our network sources best practices and resources through engagement with local and regional organizations, companies.  Both local and global people to co-create the project and execute the site specific plan.&#x20;

We recognize that:

1. most places have a long history of local and indigenous land management practices that, when modernized, can be blueprints for widespread ecological restoration,
2. outsourcing restoration work to local land stewards will create a network of regional partnerships and circulate benefits to nearby communities, which will facilitate future projects in those areas and&#x20;
3. established restoration and conservation organizations have networks of existing private-public partnerships and experience with local regulations and permits.&#x20;

The Basin Tributary model facilitates this type of collaboration and customization.  Of course each project is different and some will demand collective governance and some can be operated by a small group of people.  The key is [Adaptive Capacity](../../why/manifesto/adaptive-capacity.md).

## Legacy Matters

$BASIN is designed to be a legacy asset.  An asset people are proud to pass on to their kids and their kid's kids.  The perpetual nature of The Basin Trust creates the perpetual stewardship needed for healthy, balanced and peaceful world.

## So how does all this come together?

Projects, Properties and People need a Protocol.
