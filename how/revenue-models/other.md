## Miscellaneous Revenue Models&#x20;

These revenue models supplement the main revenue models.

These strategies help “bridge gaps” in financial feasibility but also extend network collaboration and reduce the cost of capital.  Most are already existing and can be used today.

### Depreciation & Tax Deductions Credits

A primary benefit of real estate investment is the depreciation deduction.  Without buildings, this will be lower than competing investments; however, we plan to maximize this strategy through aggressive but reasonable classification of land improvements and cost segregation for accelerated depreciation.  &#x20;

In addition to depreciation we are also looking at the new tax deductions in the recent IRA / Climate Bill. &#x20;

We will use conservation easement tax credits and stormwater credits to improve after-tax cash flows.  _Note: We are **NOT** using the Conservation Easement Syndication model which is on the IRS Dirty Dozen list._

The Basin Foundation is using real estate and oil and gas donations.

Pending legal guidance, these will be passed through to PropCo investors and/or be passed through to $BASIN holders as co-op patronage benefits.

### Grants

Basin has received non-dilutive grant funding from Regen Network and Gitcoin.   We are exploring numerous US Federal grants through USDA, NRCS and the new Infrastructure and IRA climate bills.  There are also numerous grant funding programs in the blockchain space for tokenomics and engineering.

### RFP's & RFQ's

Requests For Proposals and Request For Qualifications are a potential source of projects.  The main Basin Tributaries are working on streamlining these opportunities for Basin Members.

### Data Markets

At the core, we believe that data should be free and open but with privacy controls. &#x20;

However, there is a big move towards climate data as "the next big play".   While we disagree with this approach, the mass monetization of data and proprietary control as historically practiced, we do see an opportunity to use this (within reason) to make projects financially feasible.

As long as privacy controls are in place and consent is given by the appropriate parties under non-exclusive license then data markets are on the table for project and property income.   **Data from Basin's MRV approach combined with projects and properties might make Basin a serious player in the climate data space rivaling that of governments.**&#x20;

### Risk Reduction

A large part of our thesis is built on the premise that the activities we propose will reduce systemic risk for society and the global financial system.  However this is generally hard to quantify and pinpoint which exact stakeholder it benefits.  We do believe though there are ways to quantify this and we plan to iterate on this.  A good example is upstream / downstream analysis and Hudson River watershed for NYC’s drinking water or mangroves and the reduced insurance costs to property and building owners in coastal areas.  Our storytelling and media model combined with our holistic value approach is well suited to showcase these types of projects and causal relationships that have historically been hard to convey and implement.  We are currently in discussion and outreach to "buyers / users" of risk reduction and plan to share these opportunities with Members.
