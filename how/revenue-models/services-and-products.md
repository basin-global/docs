# Services & Products

## Climate Project Needs

We set out to provide and connect everything a climate project developer could want or need.  Key to this is Services and Products, either finding and incentivizing existing service providers or creating and building our own.

Services and Products are provided by Basin [Tributaries and Confluences](../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/).

## Climate Project Development

Basin is creating, sourcing and connecting products and services for real estate based climate, nature and carbon projects. Using the Basin Property Protocol anyone can build on top of or add to these for use on Basin projects and properties.

This revenue stream is based on [projects.md](../strategy/projects.md "mention") and [holdco-opco-propco](../business-model/holdco-opco-propco/ "mention") needs.  Approved Products and Services are added via [Governance](../../what/governance/).
