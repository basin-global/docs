# Revenue Models

## Network Activity

Revenues are generated from the activities of the Basin HoldCo, OpCo's and PropCo's (Tributaries) and Confluences.

The revenue models are part the [basin-property-protocol](../../what/basin-property-protocol/ "mention") and [usdbasin-refi-mechanism](../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/ "mention")where all network activity supports the ecosystem.  Similar to a trophic pyramid, food web or mycelial network or.... river system.... energy and resources get transferred throughout the Basin.  Revenues flow through Basin via Tributary pro rata OpCo/PropCo ownership percentages or via Confluence Eddyline (swaps) activity.

$BASIN is representative of the network value in entirety while $STREAMS are the stocks and flows of that value.

## Basin Revenue Sources

Basin revenues come from (not in order; unranked):

* Carbon
* Natural Capital
* Services
* Traditional
* $BASIN Sales & Swaps and
* Other

Generally, we are initially evaluating projects based on their _Carbon_ revenue potential as this is where most of the market interest is.  Although we expect _Natural Capital_ to be massive and predict that it will be a larger market than carbon, we are currently treating it as pure upside.  _Traditional_ and _Other_ revenue streams are treated as bridges to “make the numbers work” for climate focused projects.  _Services_ and _$BASIN Sales & Swaps_ are enterprise/network value focused but are indicative how the network operates and how the parts come together to form a greater whole that is $BASIN.

### Expenses

While not revenue of course, [Project](../strategy/projects.md) and [Property](../strategy/properties.md) cost and expenses are determinate factors of financial feasibility.  We cover those in the next section: [costs-and-expenses.md](../costs-and-expenses.md "mention")

## Revenue Order

We debated what order the revenue sources should be ordered in.  Should they be ordered by:

* Potential market size?
* Potential impact?
* Feasibility?
* Lowest risk?
* Speed to Market?

If we are talking market size and impact, Natural Capital is the winner with Carbon in second place.  However, when being realistic about our roadmap and our own financial feasibility, ranking by speed to market at the lowest risk makes the most sense.

### Revenue Ranking

| A: Market Size & Impact | B: Feasibility, Lowest Risk, Speed to Market |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Natural Capital         | Services                                     |
| Carbon                  | Traditional                                  |
| Traditional             | Other                                        |
| Services                | Carbon                                       |
| $BASIN Sales & Swaps    | $BASIN Sales & Swaps                         |
| Other                   | Natural Capital                              |

The “A” side ordering is incredibly exciting and cutting edge.  The “B” side is conservative and realistic.

As much as we would like to shoot for the moon and follow the “A” order, the prudent place to execute from is in the “B” order. &#x20;

It should be noted again that we do not plan to execute all, or even most of, the projects ourselves.  Basin is a protocol and a platform that anyone can build on top of.   Providing the framework and tools for anyone to do project development is key to achieving our goal of deployable, scalable and repeatable climate solutions.  Tributaries of course can and will use the same tools as Confluences and they will sometimes compete against each other.  But the point is to scale as much climate action and impact as fast as possible and competition should foster this. &#x20;

While we can build many of these things simultaneously and will,  the following sections are ordered according to **feasibility, lowest risk and speed to market**:

1. Services
2. Traditional
3. Other
4. Carbon
5. $BASIN Sales & Swaps
6. Natural Capital
