# Problem & Opportunity

It is not just the size of the market that is attractive, it is also the size of the problem and the gap that needs to be filled.

## Problem&#x20;

The problem/opportunity gap has been clearly articulated by many experts and institutions including and not limited to Costanza and Dasgupta but the most poignant and succinct comes from former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson’s Paulson Institute, the Nature Conservancy and Cornell University's report: [Financing Nature](https://www.paulsoninstitute.org/conservation/financing-nature-report/).

**Basin was created to fill this gap.**

### Notable highlights from Financing Nature: Closing the Global Biodiversity Financing Gap and The Cost of Biodiversity Loss

* Earth is experiencing dramatic and accelerating biodiversity loss caused by human activities. Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, scientists estimate **the world is now losing species at up to 1,000 times the natural rate** of one to five species per year. The abundance of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians has declined, on average, by 60 percent over the last four decades—the blink of an eye in evolutionary terms. If human society continues on this trajectory, **we face a future where 30 to 50 percent of all species may be lost by the middle of the 21st century**.&#x20;
* Biodiversity is essential for the health of our planet, yet it is in a sharp decline, driven mainly by human behavior. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recently warned that **humans are exploiting nature far more rapidly than it can renew itself**.&#x20;
* Research from the World Economic Forum shows that US$ 44 trillion of global GDP—around half—is highly or moderately dependent on nature.  Here’s just one small example: the worldwide loss of all pollinators (including bees, butterflies, moths and other insects) would lead to a drop in annual agricultural output of about US$ 217 billion.&#x20;
* Although we will never be able to calculate the full value of nature, we know enough to recognize that its destruction presents profound risks to human societies, and, as with any serious risk we face, **the rational response is to take out an insurance policy. In the case of biodiversity loss, the insurance policy must be a comprehensive, worldwide effort to appropriately value, protect, and restore nature**.

#### Global biodiversity conservation financing compared to global biodiversity conservation needs (US$ billions)

#### Global biodiversity conservation funding needs

Basin is designed to work on all of these [project types](../../strategy/projects.md).

### The Paulson Institute recommendations are pointed squarely at Basin

* **Nature-Based Solutions and Carbon Markets:** Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems is one of the best ways to mitigate carbon emissions. By investing in these solutions, governments can meet their climate goals and protect nature at the same time. Including emission reductions from natural landscapes in carbon markets or leveraging other financial incentives creates additional economic rationale to protect nature.&#x20;
* **Investment in Natural Infrastructure:**  Reefs, forests, wetlands, and other natural systems provide habitats for wildlife while delivering important ecosystem services such as watershed and coastal protection. In some cases, natural infrastructure is more cost-effective than engineered solutions.&#x20;
* **Expand Biodiversity Offset Mechanisms**: Agriculture, infrastructure, and extractive industries that unavoidably and negatively impact nature should offset the harm they cause by carrying out impact mitigation measures or paying to restore degraded ecosystems or protect at-risk ecosystems.&#x20;
* **Expand Green Financial Products**: Interest in sustainable investing has exploded in recent years, but investments that directly benefit nature lag behind, in quantity, investments in low-carbon infrastructure. Financial institutions can help by expanding investment opportunities in green bonds, low-interest green loans, environmental impact bonds, and other green financial products. Governments can assist by creating incentives, clear guidance, and standards for these investments.

## Opportunity

In reality, the intrinsic and inherent value of natural capital is infinite and can't be quantified.  However in the face of the climate and nature crises we no have a choice but to measure what matters and price what is valuable.&#x20;

### Potential Value of Natural Capital

### New Nature Economy

World Economic Forum “New Nature Economy” predicts:

### Global Value of Ecosystem Services

This table from Costanza et al shows per Hectare per year value of ecosystem services.  These per year numbers align with Basin's per acre per year modeling to show the value of year by year by year.  I.e. Urban is $16,459 per acre per year of value flow and swamps/floodplains are $63,461 per acre per year.  This is from 2011 and if recalculated the numbers would be much higher.  One the main goals of $STREAMS is account for the Stocks and Flows of Natural Capital.

### Payment for Ecosystem Services

Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) markets continue to grow.  A 2018 study shows considerable increase in Payments for Ecosystem Services - programs that exchange value for land management practices intended to provide or ensure ecosystem services - with over 550 active programs around the globe and an estimated $36-$42B in annual transactions.

PES markets are broken down into separate ecosystem services similar to what the [basinStack](../../../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md) is building.

### Habitat Restoration

Compliance markets for habitat restoration conservation are well-developed, transacting an estimated $4.8 billion in 2016.&#x20;

### Water & Nutrients Markets

Watershed services are the largest and most rapidly growing type of payment schemes: $24.7 billion in 62 countries in 2015, up from $6.7 billion in 2009.&#x20;

### Too Many to Count

The value that nature contributes to people is almost unfathomable.  However, in our attempt to price what is valuable, we have forthcoming data estimating and equating the financial benefits of other ecosystem services and natural capital including but not limited to:

* risk reduction
* resilience
* recreational
* educational
* cultural
* spiritual
* historical
