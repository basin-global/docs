### Use what works, discard what doesn't

Our overall revenue model uses the fundamentals of real estate investment and private property ownership with the addition of carbon and natural capital strategies for climate positive outcomes.&#x20;

At the base level, no “normal, traditional or customary” real estate strategy is off the table.  Our [team](../../what/community/team-key-contributors.md) has experience in these areas.  Most of these concepts are well known and documented and therefore we will not go into the details of each.

* Real Estate Development
* Redevelopment
* Building and Construction
* Infrastructure
* Land Subdivision
* Leasing, Subleasing & Sale Leasebacks
* Adaptive Reuse & Historic Preservation
* Restoration & Remediation
* Conservation Easements&#x20;
* Oil & Gas
* Water
* Hospitality
* SaaS
* Conventional & Structured Finance
* Private and Public Capital Markets
* Value-Add, Opportunistic & Core
* Fix N Flip

All these are part of the [basinStack](../../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md) to make any climate project financially feasible and take property to its Higher and Better Use.
