# Ecosystem & Ecological Carbon

## Per Acre, Per Year

As discussed we are taking an annual income approach similar to NOI (net operating income) in investment real estate.   **NCI** could be called Net Carbon Income but we call it **Net Climate Income** as it takes into account the [basinStack](../../../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md).

Our thesis around NCI is threefold:

1. Annualizing this keeps in line with the commonly accepted practice of NOI and cap rates of the global real estate investment markets as well as rent setting for the climate.lease.  This structure mobilizes agnostic and indifferent capital to the climate, nature and carbon spaces.
2. In a world of rapidly increasing carbon prices we want to be able to sell at the then current market prices: year by year by year.&#x20;
3. The carbon cycle is season by season, year by year, day by day.  Incentivizing carbon sink and ecosystem restoration and stewardship year by year is perpetual and if structured correctly accounts for permanence.&#x20;

Our annual approach is _similar_ to but different from NCX [Tonne-Year](https://ncx.com/learning-hub/what-is-tonne-year-accounting-and-how-it-is-used/) accounting, Nori Carbon Removal Tonne ([NRT](https://nori.com/faq)) or Regen Network [Stewardship](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv9cWCRpnPdw7u40jEiL8tQBTj5vNe2li) (practice based) Methodology.  We have yet to work out the exact differences or comparisons but welcome collaboration from people and organizations who are interested or working on this.

To arrive at this number we are using scientific data of carbon sequestration in different ecosystems, land types and carbon sinks **per acre, per year**.  Our research ([License](../../../formalities/license.md))  shows wide ranges of .5 to 15 tonnes per acre per year. &#x20;

Most data falls in the 1.5 to 5 tonnes per acre per year.&#x20;

For simplicity, we will use 1,000 acres:

This range of carbon price, while very speculative, shows the potential growth of the markets and what it does to revenue.  These revenues and tonnes could easily be converted into forward contracts or lump sum revenue today as is custom in the current carbon markets.&#x20;
