# Carbon

## A Carbon Universe

Carbon is considered the primary building block of life on earth.  It is a major component of the evolutionary scheme in the universe because of its abundance and its ability to form complex species.  This is due to carbon's ability to form stable bonds with many elements, including itself.  There are nearly 10 million carbon-based compounds in living things.

In a warming world, reducing atmospheric carbon and carbon equivalents (GHG's) is key. &#x20;

**For Basin though, carbon removal, while important, is a co-benefit of functioning healthy ecosystems and a thriving society.   Carbon is a means to the end of restoring and conserving nature and carbon sinks.**

## Carbon as a Funding Mechanism

We are looking at **all** ways to create, mint and sell carbon from real estate and property rights.  There are several more we are working on but the current main carbon revenue models are:

* Ecosystem / Ecological Carbon
* Carbon Retirement Portfolios
* Whole Life Carbon of Buildings
* Experimental Carbon

Our initial models are built to work at current market carbon pricing with the future upside of increased pricing creating: a) higher profits and/or b) higher land cost project feasibility.   Higher profits and more projects equal more climate impact in the [usdbasin-refi-mechanism](../../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/ "mention").

We are writing and plan to create methodologies for Basin and Basin Members in whatever Registries are most pertinent.  We are currently working on methodologies for these Registries and Marketplaces:

* Regen Registry
* Puro.Earth&#x20;
* Dovu
* Basin Foundation Registry

The basinStack is a holistic real estate based methodology that is focused on breadth rather than depth.  If further depth of any layer of the stack is needed, i.e. soil carbon or methane destruction carbon etc, the basinStack is modular and can be substituted with more in-depth methodologies as the market may require.

## Carbon Market Considerations

There are two types of carbon markets.  Compliance and Voluntary.

The Carbon Offset Guide [defines](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/mandatory-voluntary-offset-markets/) them as follows:

### Compliance Markets

> Compliance markets are created and regulated by mandatory national, regional, or international carbon reduction regimes.&#x20;

### Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM)

> Voluntary markets function outside of compliance markets and enable companies and individuals to purchase carbon offsets on a voluntary basis with no intended use for compliance purposes.

## ICROA Standards

ICROA stands for International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance.  [ICROA](https://www.icroa.org/) is a non-profit initiative housed within the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA).  It is important to note that ICROA works in the VCM , not the Compliance markets.  ICROA does not sell carbon credits or provide offsetting advisory services.  They do however offer the ICROA Accreditation Program which defines and promotes best practice in the financing of high-quality emissions reductions and use of carbon credits as an effective carbon management tool.

ICROA accredited organizations commit to use carbon credits based on the following principles : **Real, Measurable, Permanent, Independently Verified, Additional and Unique**.

IRCOA [also](https://www.icroa.org/offsetting) emphasizes Co-Benefits and distinguishes between Removals and Avoidance:

### Co-Benefits

> Many carbon projects also provide a variety of so-called co-benefits making a positive environmental, economic, social and cultural impact. Some examples include local biodiversity support, advancing local infrastructure, providing additional jobs and education opportunities for local communities, or fostering gender equality through training programs and employment opportunities for women. Co-benefits offer additional value to companies by helping them meet their sustainability commitments.

### Removals

> Removal credits stem from activities that absorb, or pull, carbon out of the atmosphere, such as many nature-based solutions (eg, reforestation, peatland restoration, mangrove restoration) as well as engineered methods such as direct air capture and accelerated mineral weathering.

### Avoidance

> Avoidance credits come from projects that reduce emissions by preventing their release into the atmosphere in the first place. These projects reduce emissions compared with the most likely scenario, ie the baseline. For example, REDD+ projects reduce forestry loss and preserve existing forests. New renewable energy projects also generate avoidance credits, when installed in a grid/region where fossil fuel-based energy dominates. Here, future emissions are reduced by using better alternatives, while existing CO2 is left untouched.

## Basin Carbon Commentary

While we agree with and support _most_ of what ICROA is doing but we do have differing opinions in the context of Basin's work. &#x20;

An important thing to remember here is that VCM stands for Voluntary Carbon Markets with the keyword being _**Voluntary**_.  We will leave it up to the market and the carbon and natural capital buyers to decide what characteristics they seek in their net-zero and ESG goals.

**The comments below are based on the VCM in general, not just ICROA.  Comments are provided as a supplement to our overall** [**Strategy**](../../strategy/) **in which **_**carbon is just a part of**_**.**

## Carbon Markets

As needed, Basin will use normal and customary carbon market practices such as prompt delivery, off-take agreements and ex-ante sales as well as use commonly accepted integrity and quality standards.  Basin will use existing legacy methodologies where feasible and appropriate however, in the face of climate change, our focus in on newer registries and marketplaces with faster speed to market at lower cost.

Our main concern is that the carbon markets need to change and innovate towards a more holistic ecosystem and carbon cycle approach.  We intend to be a part of this evolution.

## Additionality&#x20;

Additionality is commonly defined as _the reductions in emissions achieved by the project must be “above business as usual” and they would not have happened unless the project was implemented and/or as a result of carbon financing_.  Under this scenario project developers must prove their project was additional and that carbon finance either prevented emissions or added new removals.&#x20;

In our opinion, in a 420+ PPM world contemplating 1 to 2+ °C baked in warming that can’t really be mitigated, every carbon removal activity is additional.   **Unless both legally protected and stewarded in-fact, every ecosystem, carbon sink and species is threatened and at risk and therefore additional.**  (basis: [IPCC SR15 Ch.3](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15\_Chapter3\_Low\_Res.pdf))

## Permanence

In any given carbon removal, the length of the removal matters.  However, we need to stop calling it permanence. &#x20;

Nothing is permanent.  It is all a cycle.  The Carbon Cycle.  The Water Cycle.  The death and decay cycle.  The only thing permanent are the cycles of change and change itself.

Want permanent carbon removal?  Remove it year by year by year in perpetuity.  Just like photosynthesis has been doing for 3 billion years.   We can't pay ecosystems for their services but markets can pay people to restore and steward these ecosystems and carbon sinks.

### Perpetual Stewardship

The main rationale here is moving away from outcome based crediting to practice based crediting. Practice based is still outcome focused but sets the stage for long term systemic change.&#x20;

Philosophically and practically, society needs to remove carbon year by year, by day by day, and this action should be incentivized.  Existing carbon sinks should be protected, new carbon sinks created and damaged ones restored by paying project developers and local stakeholders to steward these sinks.  Paying them year by year or season by season leaves money to pay them next year at the then current market prices rather than a forward sale taking all the future value away from the project today.&#x20;

Annualizing the carbon removal process and income streams will further allow for application of cap rates (via climate.lease) to carbon and nature projects for eventual standardization and project comparison.   Cap rates take into account project quality and risk.

Tonne years and similar concepts are already being used by NCX and Nori.  Practice based methods are being [co-created](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv9cWCRpnPdw7u40jEiL8tQBTj5vNe2li) in Regen Network and Open Forest Protocol appears to also be working under the year by year tonnes sequestered model.

### Tonne Years

Tonne Years have varied definitions and interpretations.    Our interpretation is one tonne removed over one year.  i.e. a grassland sequestering 1 tonne CO2 per acre per year is one tonne year or coastal wetlands restoration sequestering an average of 12 tonnes of CO2 per year per hectare is 12 tonne years.

As outlined we are taking an annual income approach similar to NOI (net operating income) in investment real estate.   **NCI** could be called Net Carbon Income but we call it **Net Climate Income** as it takes into account the holistic [basinStack](../../../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md).

Two important points of discussion around carbon markets and Tonne Years in the context of ecosystem and carbon sink restoration and preservation are:

1. The natural carbon cycle is season by season, year by year, day by day.  Incentivizing carbon sink and ecosystem restoration and stewardship year by year is perpetual and if structured correctly accounts for permanence.&#x20;
2. Annualizing this keeps in line with the commonly accepted practice of NOI and cap rates of the global real estate investment markets.  This structure will mobilize agnostic and indifferent capital to the climate, nature and carbon spaces.

Removals should be measured, priced and sold annually.   Quantifying removals in per acre per year or per hectare per year naturally aligns with the carbon cycle as well as real estate investment.

### Bankrupting Nature

Selling removals ex ante or under an offtake agreement has its benefits of cash upfront payment or and committed pre-sales to finance projects however this could bankrupt nature.  For example, let's say a forest project crediting period is 70 years and the project developer sells 50 years of those credits upfront (buffer approach) and moves onto the next project.  What assurances are there that the forest/project is stewarded for 70 years?  If operational or replacement costs go up 15 or 20 years into the project, what happens when 50 years of revenue is already removed from the project?  Who foots the bill?  As a society, if we go around selling the future value of an ecosystem today, we run the risk of not being able to steward those ecosystems.  Similar to physical infrastructure (bridges and roads etc), the projected project life is supposed to be funded and accounted for BUT when repairs and replacements cost more than the budget, who foots the bill?   The future generations do or unrelated parties do.  The project developers and speculators are long gone.&#x20;

## High Quality

Stripe, Microsoft and many other leading carbon buyers have been focusing on “high quality” removals.  While Stripe emphasizes permanence, Microsoft has publicly added nature based solutions with multiple societal co-benefits to their buying criteria.  Large insurance companies such as SwissRe and the leading international banks are also adding co-benefits such as biodiversity and pollination to their buying criteria due to the risk reduction and additional societal value co-benefits created.  Basin's holistic stacking and bundling strategy ([basinStack](../../../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md)) takes this into account and builds on it.&#x20;

We envision our carbon tonnes chock full of societal co-benefits.  While the price will be denominated in tonnes, the benefits far outweigh the cost.  We view our tonnes as the “luxury” carbon product offering and will use storytelling and art to justify higher than market prices.  Some of our modeling indicates being able to sell Basin tonnes at 10X prevailing carbon market prices or more.  We also see this as the on-ramp to selling and establishing the natural capital market by separating out certain ecological assets in an unbundling and leasing/selling them apart from carbon.

## MRV

MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) is a big and important term in carbon markets.  However, MRV is core to everything we do at Basin and is related to much much more than Carbon.  MRV is the source of truth and whether not we are having impact or not.  Impact is directly related to our [Tokenomics](../../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tokenomics/).

A more detailed overview of our MRV strategy can be found [here](../../strategy/protocol.md).
