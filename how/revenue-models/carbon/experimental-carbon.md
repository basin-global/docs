# Experimental Carbon

Most carbon sequestration needs land, property, property rights or legal lease/use agreements.  If a project has these characteristics Basin is or will be a part of it.

We are working on and exploring the following which have justification but need data and research.  All can be quantified and measured either empirically or statistically.&#x20;

### Animal Carbon

Animal's obviously play critical roles in ecosystems but their role in the carbon cycle is often times overlooked.  Elk, beaver, wildebeests, beavers, elephants, rhinos, etc all play important carbon sequestration roles and the protection and restoration of species could be monetized with carbon.

### Blue Carbon

As Basin primarily focuses on land and water with "property rights" and clear rule of law, Ocean and navigable waterways are mostly out of Basin's purview.  However there is opportunity along the coasts where property rights are clear related to the high tide marks.  There is opportunity in estuaries and coastal wetlands including mangals (mangrove forests).  We also could work on projects where lease or use agreements are common, for example the growing and sinking of seaweed and giant kelp.

### CCUS - Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage

We have talked to numerous DAC companies and startups who need land and underground storage.  We have also had several discussions around Class VI and Class II well permits and state primacy laws.  There are also ongoing discussions around a “DAC Hub” as a test facility.  Basin is planning to be the real estate partner for CCUS projects.

### Coal

As part of our ["Keep It in the Ground" Methodology](carbon-retirement-portfolios.md) we are also working on Coal mines and mineral rights.  This is above and beyond the leaking methane and applies to the mineral rights and the BOE of CO2e.

### N2O

Nitrous oxide accounts for about 7% of all U.S. GHG's from human activities such as agriculture, fuel combustion, wastewater management, and industrial processes.  Nitrous oxide molecules stay in the atmosphere for an average of 114 years before being removed by a sink or destroyed through chemical reactions.  The impact of 1 pound of N2O on warming the atmosphere is almost 300 times that of 1 pound of carbon dioxide.  We are looking at real estate solutions around N2O which involve waste, wastewater, fertilizer, land use and agriculture and the bacteria, ultraviolet radiation and chemical reactions needed to break it down or sequester it.

### Land Use Carbon

Biochar, BECCS, enhanced weathering also all need land.

### Renewable Energy Production & Storage

While not our core product as we don’t plan to compete with solar and wind producers we do plan to offer them land for lease or sale.
