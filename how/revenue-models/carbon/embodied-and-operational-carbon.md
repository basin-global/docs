### Embodied & Operational Carbon of Buildings

Buildings have two types of carbon: embodied carbon and operational carbon. &#x20;

Embodied carbon accounts for the carbon emissions from all aspects of the building’s life cycle (material production, transportation, etc. considered Scope 3) unrelated to its operations.  Operational carbon is the carbon emissions resulting from the energy used to operate a building (lights, air conditioning, elevators, etc. which is considered Scope 1&2).

A recent embodied carbon example from the 2022 carbon market is Snapchat’s (SNAP) [recent purchase](https://carbonherald.com/snap-uses-puro-earth-projects-for-reducing-emissions/) of 8,000 mtCO2e of embodied carbon from Puro.earth.  This is the first carbon removal standard for engineered carbon removal methods in building products. &#x20;

The world's leading architects, building councils and developers (such as [Hines](https://www.hines.com/embodied-carbon-reduction-guide)) are making carbon assessment core to their operations and we expect to see more research and methodology development around this.

## "Don't Build, REuse" Methodology&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Our open source methodology is in private beta.  We are seeking contributors and reviewers.  Please [contact us](../../../quick-links/make-contact.md) if you want to participate.  &#x20;
{% endhint %}

As part of the [basinStack](../../../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md) we assess what exists on a site already and what could be built, similar to a Highest and Best Use (HBU) analysis used in appraisal practice.  We then calculate the square footage that “**won’t be built**” and what will be “**reused**” under our land use and development plan and the resulting emission reductions for embodied and operational carbon.

Embodied and operational carbon data is still nascent but significant research has been done and is ongoing.  The best examples are:&#x20;

* Denver’s Building Sector Embodied Carbon Emissions [report](https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/climate-action/documents/hpbh/nze/denvers-building-sector-embodied-carbon-emissions-june-2021.pdf)&#x20;
* Embodied Carbon Benchmark Study which is the largest known [database](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/lca-benchmark-database/) of building embodied carbon.
* Applied Energy [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919317945?via%3Dihub): “Embodied GHG emissions of buildings – The hidden challenge for effective climate change mitigation”&#x20;

Using data from these sources, we can generally conclude:

SMR Research found that at the end of 2021, the average U.S. commercial building was about 53 years old.  Most research shows that buildings last between 50-60 years before needing to be replaced or significantly overhauled.  The IRS sets the useful life at 39 years for commercial buildings and 27.5 for multifamily buildings.  We use 50 years in our modeling.

Using the above analysis we can estimate two revenue scenarios: 1) “_**Don't Build**_” and 2) “_**REuse**_”.  We are working on methodologies for both of these to sell avoided emission carbon credits.  Please [contact us](../../../quick-links/make-contact.md) to help with the methodology or to use the methodology.

### “Don’t Build”

This strategy is aligned with our conservation and natural capital thesis.  We look at the highest and best use of a site and calculate what the building/improvement square footage would be based on HBU.  We then legally limit the development rights of the property and calculate the whole life carbon (EC & OC) of that restriction over the useful life of the building.

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nZlMeLbRZF3ImovLlRVZj27m3-ahIn-9CZm1iRYuN4G120qWOXUjqsEHYrRzhgKw1FKC12oaUbJDa0H7PYiTL6m2tmJW2IvXye84ay3WJ-Y9BPOOLkL4L4Wr1MAENQAZCAuFUx8verAADGywIMgqcpSInUsNpLrPKcaN-waZSUdVRJl2D3Z9EJDBew" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The building restrictions could be put on the land in whatever increment works for the developer and the project.  i.e. 5, 10 or 50 years and be prorated accordingly.

### “REuse”

Using similar calculations to the _**Don’t Build**_ strategy we look at what the embodied carbon is of any existing buildings that would otherwise be torn down under HBU. We then look at adaptive reuse strategies and calculate both the carbon that is in the existing building which is being reused as well as the energy and waste that would have been created during the demolition.

We see this strategy working well with historic buildings as well as buildings that are considered functionally obsolete.  Bloomberg estimates that $2.2T worth of commercial buildings are [obsolete](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-14/u-s-office-buildings-face-a-1-1-trillion-obsolescence-problem).

For every 1M square feet of buildings “not built” this is \~325,000 tonnes not emitted and for every 1M sf of buildings reused is 56,000 tonnes not emitted.  This is, of course, in addition to the Ecosystem / Ecological Carbon and Natural Capital from the site.

While the numbers are not huge by themselves, when combined with other additive revenue and expense reduction strategies of the basinStack, they start to add up and help make climate, carbon and nature projects financially feasible.
