# Costs & Expenses

## Fundamentals

As a real estate based solution for the climate, nature and carbon crises we pull from three tenets of commercial and investment real estate:

1. Financial Feasibility
2. The best investors make their money when they buy
3. The deal speaks for itself

The Basin model is built on baking in as much upside to every project as possible as to not be overly dependent on carbon prices and emerging natural capital sales.  Onboarding property rights and properties at the lowest possible cost and separating out many of the expenses according to the [HoldCo OpCo PropCo](business-model/holdco-opco-propco/) model does this.

We often refer to projects and properties as a “Deal”.  Deal means each property or project as a stand alone entity based on location, strategy, partners and PropCo/OpCo.  If each Basin deal can stand on its own with its own revenue and expenses, then the Basin platform stands on its own.  The cumulative effect is value accrual to $BASIN and “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.

## Financial Feasibility

“Financial Feasibility” is one of the main metrics in real estate appraisal and valuation and used in the traditional Highest and Best Use analysis (which varies from our different from our Higher and Better Use model).  In order for a property / project to be financially feasible it has to pencil based on project cost _and_ projected income.  Income in real estate is net income not gross, this is commonly referred to as Net Operating Income (NOI).

The Basin model is built on financial feasibility.  How do we make as many climate projects as possible financially feasible?  The high level answer is simple: lower cost, increase income and reduce expenses.  Costs affect the overall yield of a project whereas NOI affects the market value.

### Costs

Costs are the costs of acquiring property and property rights both which, in our case, have to include natural capital and carbon among other rights to structure deals properly.  Costs also include getting a project up and running aka the hard and soft costs of development.  Costs can be paid by the PropCo or OpCo.  In most cases the PropCo (developer) will shoulder most of them but this deal dependent.

### Income

We cover income in the [Revenue](revenue-models/) sections.  Our approach is stacked revenue streams using the [basinStack](../what/basin-property-protocol/basinstack.md).

### Expenses

Expenses are the costs of operating the project annually.  Depending on property type these are paid by the OpCo (Tenant) or PropCo (Landlord).  Our [HOP](business-model/holdco-opco-propco/) model is flexible.

### NOI to NCI

Income minus expenses equals NOI.  Valuation of income property is based off of NOI.  In our case we want increase income and reduce income to raise NOI **but** we want to do it in a climate friendly way that includes considerations of carbon, nature and people.  We call this Net Climate Income (NCI).  If we do our job correctly all projects will be based on NCI not legacy NOI.

## "We don't pay for upside or potential."

As the saying goes in commercial and investment real estate:

“_The best investors do not pay for upside or potential. They make their money when they buy._”

"Buying Right" and adding value via increased income and lower expenses is core to how we scale climate, carbon and nature projects.

One of the core functions of the [Basin Property Protocol](../what/basin-property-protocol/) is bringing property and property rights in at costs lower than open / on-market pricing.  In fact most on-market properties will not pencil for climate uses simply due to the markup of a public sale offering.  In a nutshell we look for and onboard problem properties or problem ownerships and solve for both.  We expect our methods to onboard properties at anywhere between 10% to 95% below market value.  Yes, 95% below market value.

Here is an overview of how the Basin Property Protocol brings on properties at lower costs for Basin Members.  Basin [Members](../what/community/network-participants/members.md) get access to these deals as [Confluences and Tributaries](../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/).

### basin.foundation

Annual charitable giving in the US is around $400B per year, $8B of that is real estate.  The [Basin Foundation](broken-reference) is working to capture a significant portion of this market by targeting donors with land, acreage, hard to sell, hard to lease, obsolete and contaminated properties.  2% of $8B is $160M.

How much carbon and natural capital can be created from $160M worth of real estate?  That is what we are setting out to do.  Not all donated properties will be suited for climate, carbon or nature projects but this is where basin.global’s expertise comes in as to how to best evaluate and utilize or dispose of those properties.  Properties that work for restoration, regeneration and/or conservation will be held by the Foundation using a [BASIN PROPERTIES LLC](broken-reference) Series to limit liability and then will be leased under a arm’s length streaming agreement to either a Tributary or Confluence OpCo with the Foundation getting a share of the revenue and the PropCo and Trust retaining the rest subject to the specific property financial structure.  The costs associated with accepting donations is borne by the Foundation.  Properties that do not fit the Basin mission will be sold with the proceeds going to the Foundation to support the basin.global network.

### Surplus/Excess Properties

City, State and Federal governments and large corporations all have surplus and excess real estate and regularly sell (or attempt to sell) these properties.  [BASIN LLC](broken-reference) is onboarding and other OpCo's can onboard these portfolio owners as a wholesale opportunities.  We also plan on responding to RFP’s and public bidding processes.  Furthermore these owners are well suited for the [climate.lease](../what/basin-property-protocol/climate.lease.md) sale-leaseback model and/or bargain sales with participation from the Foundation.

### Motivated Sellers / Distressed Properties

In commercial real estate it is common for large investors to hire “bird dogs” or network with brokers to find target properties.  The Basin “Scout” program does this.  Scouts find properties that meet the network criteria but also have seller motivation such as distress, back taxes, estate/heir issues, obsolescence, pollution, contamination etc.

### Stranded Assets

In a rapidly changing world, many properties are becoming “stranded” on companies balance sheets due to lack of marketability or large potential write-downs.  Our model is specifically built to work with stranded asset owners to make them a real asset again, not a liability.

### Streaming

Using lease or use “streaming” agreements we will work with landowners who don't know how or don’t want to do any of the work related to carbon and natural capital etc.  This onboards property rights for almost zero upfront cost.  The expense then is just the revenue share.



All properties onboarded via the above means will be available for $BASIN Members.

## The deal speaks for itself

Deals and properties are what they are.  The income and expenses don't lie.  But real estate markets are inefficient and opaque.  This presents an opportunity to create and tell a better story around every project/property/deal.

Revenues have already been discussed.  Related to expenses, the Basin Property Protocol does two things :

1. establishes and shares best practices of expenses and market rates and
2. the OpCo PropCo model allows flexibility of where to place the expenses.

Every type of project will have different expense ranges and be unique to the project and property location.  Most expenses will be up to each project OpCo and PropCo to manage but projects can appeal to the Trust and Foundation for supplemental support.

## Other Costs and Expenses

Costs for purchasing property and acquiring property rights will come from the Trust, Foundation and/or the partners and investors on each deal, as the case may be.  This is the flexibility the HoldCo OpCo PropCo model provides.

There are fairly significant tax benefits that will be created from many of the basin.global projects as is common in real estate investment.  Depreciation and tax deductions will flow to the beneficial owners of each OpCo and PropCo prorata.  Although still in legal, we exploring whether or not token holders could also get pass-through tax benefits from the LCA cooperative patronage token structure based on patronage activity.

## Net Effect

Investment property values are based on NOI.  Every $1 dollar of NOI can drive 10X to 20X of value.  For example, a rundown marginal property has a NOI of $220,000 and we then apply the basinStack to to raise income and lower expenses and it results in an increase of NOI by 12%:  this increases the property value $264,000 to $528,000 _above_ the previous "buy" value.

Furthermore, the value increase above in most cases is meatspace financial value not the stocks of natural capital value or intrinsic value.  Natural capital value or intrinsic value stocks will be accounted for in $STREAMS.
