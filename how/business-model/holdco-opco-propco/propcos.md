# PropCo's

## Property Companies

PropCos are specific properties / pieces of real estate / polygons.  PropCo's can be a [Tributary](../../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/tributaries.md) or [Confluence](../../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/confluences.md) but are always tied to a [Basin](../../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/basins.md) (location).  They will almost always work with one or more [OpCo's](opcos.md) and have a relationship to the [HoldCo](holdco.md).

PropCo's are structured as real estate investments, common trust assets or JV's with land owners.  Certain PropCo's will be [syndicated](../../../quick-links/invest.md) and offered as Reg D securities.  PropCo's are approved via [Governance](../../../what/governance/) and through alignment of incentives, Basin helps any type of PropCo succeed.&#x20;
