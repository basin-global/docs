# OpCo's

## Operating Companies

OpCo's are the [people](../../strategy/people.md), [products and services](../../revenue-models/) that make Basin possible.  They provide and connect all the things needed for climate real estate project development and to make the network and protocol run.  OpCo's service the HoldCo and are "users" of and "vendors" for PropCo's. &#x20;

Basin is a platform to be built on top of and the sky's the limit of what kind of OpCo's could be created and built by the community.  There are lots of ideas/needs in [projects.md](../../strategy/projects.md "mention") and [services-and-products.md](../../revenue-models/services-and-products.md "mention").&#x20;

OpCo's can be [Tributaries](../../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/tributaries.md) or [Confluences](../../../what/usdbasin-refi-mechanism/tributaries-and-confluences/confluences.md), are approved via [Governance](../../../what/governance/) and through alignment of incentives, Basin helps any type of OpCo succeed.&#x20;
