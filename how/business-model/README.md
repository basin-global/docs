## Trillion Dollar Impact

Climate change is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity disguised as an existential crisis.  Many think that the first Trillionaire will be made in climate change.

**For us, it's not about the dollars, it is about the impact.** &#x20;

**What could a trillion dollars do for nature?  For ecosystems, carbon removal, social impact, people, communities and what impact could that have on your family?**

Whatever your ambitions, solving climate change is the biggest, and most important opportunity of our generation.  Whether the goal of being financially wealthy or making a decent living and providing for your family, protecting, caring for and stewarding the planet is a worthy endeavor.

**Basin is built to enable people to make a living regenerating the planet and their communities.  People should be paid and paid well for this work.** Financial wealth should accrue to those doing the work of fostering ecological wealth.  The wealth accrual can be to individuals, families, small groups, businesses, clubs, towns, villages, cities, regions.  In Basin, even wealth accrual has [Adaptive Capacity](../../why/manifesto/adaptive-capacity.md).

If Basin succeeds, the individual will prosper and the collective will flourish WHILE creating the positive change we seek to make in the world.

## Built to Last

In order to accomplish what are are setting out to do, we had to build our own model.  A hybrid, new-school, next generation model.  One that works now but that is built for the future.  A model that is built to last.  Built to out live us.  Built for 400 years or Seven Generations.

There are many existing organizational structures that helped us in this design process.

### Perpetual Evergreen Holding Companies

Despite being solely financially focused and extraction driven, Berkshire Hathaway and Koch Industries fit this mold, one as a public company and the other as a private company.

### Real Estate Investment Trusts

REIT's like Prologis, Equity, Hines, General Growth and Simon have been using the [HoldCo OpCo PropCo](holdco-opco-propco/) model for decades, almost a century.

### ESG & B Corporations

Unilever, Patagonia, Etsy, Kickstarter

### Hybrid For Profit / Not For Profit

Bosch, Newman's Own, Holdfast Collective

### Cooperatives

Mondragon (€12B Revenue, €26B assets, 80k+ employees) and REI ($3.7 billion in sales; 21 million members)

### Rights of Nature (RoN)

Holdfast Collective / Patagonia Purpose Trust, Earth Equity, RoN legal rulings and approaches

### Vertical Keiretsu

A keiretsu is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. In the legal sense, it is a type of informal business group that are loosely organized alliances within a social and business community.

### Blockchain DAO's

MakerDAO: $1B market cap MKR; $7.6B TVL; Uniswap and BitDAO total almost $5B; ENS and Gnosis over $1B each.

### Franchise Model

McDonald's is often called a real estate company that sells hamburgers.

#### Basin combines all these models for maximum climate impact.

## Restoration & Conservation

Before going into the Basin HoldCo OpCo PropCo model we need to first look at what we do.

Basin focuses on two ends of the real estate spectrum for maximum climate impact:&#x20;
